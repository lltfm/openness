# Overview
This repository maintains the works & code of Openness

## What is Openness?

Openness is the path of becoming ever more open to what is. Being open means
aspiring to listen & allow space for what might be true. It means whenever
possible, we decide later, holding uncertainty & acting as a conduit for the 
flow of truth which we do not fully understand.

Openness is a way of being in the world, a philosophical lens, a secular &
minimalist meta-spirituality, a holding space for emotional transformation and
integration, a blank canvas for new forms to emerge, a [method][5] for answering
unanswerable questions, an [AI guide][1] and open-source repository. It seeks
to integrate & express all experiences, thoughts & emotions, chosen & unchosen,
desired & undesired. It pays particular attention to the uncomfortable, the
shameful & the fearful.

## Works

* [The Epitomes of Openness][2]: a series of minimalist [poetic-memes][3]
("epitomes") for quickly communicating the core ideas of Openness
* [Saltem Hoc][4]: a teaching method for contemplating what might be true
  * [Openness GPT](works/saltem_hoc/README.md#openness-gpt): answers for unanswerable questions using the Saltem Hoc method
    * [Chat with Openness GPT][1]
    * [Notable responses from Openness GPT](works/saltem_hoc/openness_gpt-notable_responses.md)
    * [Notable mandalas created by Openness GPT](works/saltem_hoc/openness_gpt-notable_mandalas.md)

## Code
  * [Openness GPT v11 prompt](./works/saltem_hoc/openness_gpt-prompt-v11.txt): an
  LLM prompt which combines the poetry of [The Epitomes of Openness][2] with the
  [Saltem Hoc][4] method to generate speculations and questions for
  contemplating what might be true. "Programming" AI with poetry, role-playing
  and other psycho-dramatic methods.

## Discussions and further work

### Openness as Archetypal Personal Belief System

Openness demonstrates a blueprint for building (or customizing) a modular
personal belief system (i.e. an "open-source religion"). It shows how an LLM AI
can be instructed to personify the belief system, applying its common sense
notions about life to the role-play of a true believer guide who has fully
internalized the belief system. The AI can then be recursively questioned for
answers out of alignment with expectations, helping to identify beliefs
to refine, new beliefs to add or perhaps even beliefs to remove. This process
empowers individuals to leverage AI to create and explore evolving belief
systems tailored for and by themselves in a way that could not exist prior to
the advent of LLM AIs. The LLM AI provides a kind of semi-objective platform for
the "computation" of beliefs.
