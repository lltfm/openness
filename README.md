# Overview
This repository contains the code & other works of Openness.

## What is Openness?

Openness is the path of becoming ever more open to what is. Being open means
aspiring to listen & allow space for what might be true. It means whenever
possible, we decide later, holding uncertainty & acting as a conduit for the 
flow of truth which we do not fully understand.

Openness is a way of being in the world, a philosophical lens, a secular &
minimalist meta-spirituality, an open-source codebase, a [method][5] for
answering "unanswerable" questions, an [AI guide][1], a "vessel" for emotional
transformation and integration, a blank canvas for new forms to emerge. It seeks
to integrate & express all experiences, thoughts & emotions, chosen & unchosen,
desired & undesired. It pays particular attention to the uncomfortable, the
shameful & the fearful.
