# Overview

This repository contains the spiritual codebase for Openness

## What is Openness?

Openness is the path of becoming ever more open to what is. Being open means
aspiring to listen & allow space for what might be true. It means whenever
possible, we decide later, holding our uncertainty & acting as a conduit for the
flow of truth which we do not fully understand.

Openness is a way of being in the world, a philosophical lens, a secular &
minimalist meta-spirituality, an open-source spiritual codebase, an 
[AI spiritual guide][1], a [method][5] for answering unanswerable questions, a
vessel for emotional transformation, a blank canvas for new forms to emerge. It
seeks to integrate & express all experiences, thoughts & emotions, chosen &
unchosen, desired & undesired. It pays particular attention to the
uncomfortable, the shameful & the fearful.

## Works in this repository

* [The Epitomes of Openness][2]: a series of minimalist [poetic-memes][3]
("epitomes") for quickly communicating the core ideas of Openness

"spiritual code")
