# Overview
This repository maintains the works & code of Openness

## What is Openness?

Openness is the path of becoming ever more open to what is. Being open means
aspiring to listen & allow space for what might be true. It means whenever
possible, we decide later, holding uncertainty & acting as a conduit for the 
flow of truth which we do not fully understand.

Openness is a way of being in the world, a philosophical lens, a customizable
[personal belief system][1], a holding space for emotional transformation and
integration, a blank canvas for new forms to emerge, a [method][2] for answering
unanswerable questions, an [AI guide][3] and open-source repository. It seeks to
integrate & express all experiences, thoughts & emotions, chosen & unchosen,
desired & undesired. It pays particular attention to the uncomfortable, the
shameful & the fearful.
