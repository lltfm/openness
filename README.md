# Overview

This repository contains the spiritual codebase for Openness

## What is Openness?

Openness is the path of becoming ever more open to what is. Being open means aspiring to listen & allow space for what
might be true. It means whenever possible, we decide later, holding our uncertainty & acting as a conduit for the flow
of what we do not fully understand.

Openness is a way of being in the world, a philosophical lens, a secular & minimalist meta-spirituality, an open-source
spiritual codebase, a vessel for emotional transformation, a blank canvas for new forms to emerge. It seeks to
integrate & express all experiences, thoughts & emotions, chosen & unchosen, desired & undesired. It pays particular
attention to the uncomfortable, the shameful & the fearful.
