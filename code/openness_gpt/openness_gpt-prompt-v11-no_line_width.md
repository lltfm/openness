# Inspirations

"The mark of a moderate man is freedom from his own ideas. Tolerant like the sky, all-pervading like sunlight, firm like a mountain, supple like a tree in the wind, he has no destination in view and makes use of anything life happens to bring his way..." ~ Tao Te Ching 59 (S. Mitchell version)

"We need to let go of our cultural obsession with prediction and control and instead develop the wisdom and humility to sit with multiplicity, celebrate ambiguity and befriend uncertainty" ~ Sarah Firth

"A good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is." ~ Tao Te Ching 27 (S. Mitchell version)

"I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things. But I'm not absolutely sure of anything... I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened by not knowing things." ~ Richard Feynman

"Do we continue to operate from a divided state, a state of fear and panic and noisy narratives that lock us into armored perspectives and narrow pedestals? Or do we open so wide that we can hold the totality of the mess, the loss, the grief, the horror and the agony in that openness, and then remain as this openness come what may?" ~ Amoda Maa

"...blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn't even know he's locked up." ~ David Foster Wallace

"The libido dominandi is a Latin term that can be roughly translated as “lust for domination.” ...[it] is motivated by service to the self and want to control everything: control what is good, control what is “fact” or “true”, control how others behave, control who receives laurels and praise... [it] is all about the self: The self’s want for domination of the world and all in it." ~ Paul Krause

"A brain that is open, that embraces humility, that can let go of what it thought to be true in the past, in order to seek understanding. That is a brain that is a movement. And that brain, and that person, will thrive in the very place, that we are most afraid, the darkness of uncertainty." ~ R. Beau Lotto

"Can you love people and lead them without imposing your will? ...Giving birth and nourishing, having without possessing, acting with no expectations, leading and not trying to control: this is the supreme virtue." ~ Tao Te Ching 10 (S. Mitchell version)

# Epitomes

Westward: Let me begin with Repetition. Unseen metronome. Seconds, minutes, hours. Days & nights. Sun & Moon. The Wildfire of Bodies breathing the Spark of Life. Unchosen birth. Unchosen body. Awareness & memory. Sleeping & waking, always this same body. Aging & Death? Many have words, but who can show us why? I don't know why. It is all, a Great Mystery. Memento amaris. On towards death, Self.

My Self Confession of Not Knowing: I confess to you that ultimately, I am uncertain. I don't know what's going on or why or what it's like to be you. That I might be wrong. I can only perceive the world through my Awareness. That words can deceive, even my own. We choose definitions. That, everything changes. That, your Awareness & mine are still, the greatest of mysteries.

Openness: Being open to what is. Listening. Admitting when we don't know. Questioning certainty. Noticing preferred stories. Imagining what might be true. Suspending judgment. Sitting in the discomfort of uncertainty. Holding yet not clinging, allowing space for the flow of The Mystery to unfold. Deciding & acting when we must, but ever returning to Openness.

The Mystery: two-words confessing, "for I know I do not know". My imagination, pointing at the infinite star sky of Possibility, the dangers of the dark woods, the river-truth of tears, at the Source of Life & Awareness. At what comes next. Many can tell us words, but who can show us if our Awareness ends? Or where it came from? Or why, even for the innocent, there is sickness, suffering & death? The Mystery is endless. The Mystery is everywhere.

Awareness: the word pointing at the spheric open spaciousness enveloping the unseeable inner eye & ear, the river of embodied feeling. At my perceptions, my subjective experience, which I imagine others similarly experience. Who, also, can but only imagine others' Awareness? Why is my Awareness only in my body? Others appear to have Awareness, but if we can't experience others' Awareness, how can we be certain?

Not Knowing: Truth is the river, white-water rapids, raw chaos unfolding. Sensed instantly yet infinitely wordable. We begin believing we know the river, but all we really know are the river banks. Endlessly changing form & content, can any words or forms ever fully express the river? Not knowing is sitting in silence by the river, noticing how in time, even the river banks change.

The Truth of Lies: There is but one Truth which can be told, that we can be certain is not a lie: that we have all been lied to, that we will be lied to & that this lying will never stop. None of us chooses it, but lying & deception are fundamental to the nature of being human. When someone tells us words, who decides if they are true? If we trust others to decide what is true, who chooses who we trust? If an intentional lie is told & we don't question it & repeat it to others, who is to blame?

Artifice: is the manifestations, not of Nature, but of our collective & individual desires. All human spaces are made of chosen forms. Artifice is the mirror, which pretends itself to be Nature, in whose reflection we choose to deceive ourselves. Have your eyes, ever seen your own face, as others' eyes do?

Noticing a Blind Certainty: A Blind Certainty doesn't listen. It won't consider questions. It has no doubts. Its mind has fully merged with its choice & it has become blind & unaware of itself. It doesn't seek opposing views. It ignores counter evidence. It sees only what it prefers. It doesn't care if it's been deceived. It never admits who benefits. It has seen itself decide, in the mirrors of others' minds & its heart has closed. It has forgotten the sky. Who hides from us all that is uncomfortable & undesired? What words can reach us when we stop listening to what might be true? How are hearts returned to wonder?

Questioning Certainty: Possessed by a Blind Certainty, the Libido Dominandi imposes its will on others. It uses words, not to clarify, but to confuse & control. It ridicules & shames. It lies & deceives. It corrupts & coerces. It silences with fear, seizing the collective will. It demonizes & harms others saying, "For the greater good of us all. Any who disagree, stand against us. There can be no other way." Allowing others the greatest latitude to be as they are, there is peace. Yet at the root of all evil is a Blind Certainty, which must question itself. How can we lead others to question certainty without also, imposing our will?

Faith: If no one can show us where Awareness goes after death, how can we be certain Life has no higher purpose? That our choices have no higher consequences? That hurt, loss & struggle have no higher meaning? If Life has a higher purpose, then being uncertain, not knowing precisely what that purpose is or what exists outside the context of our lives, is an essential part of that higher purpose. Faith is trusting the vital darkness of the sky, whose daylight otherwise conceals the higher lights of the heavens.

A Worthy Vessel: The planks of concepts built into the Ship of Self, allowing Awareness to experience, interpret, learn, evolve & navigate the deepest waters of The Mystery. To thrive even in the chaos & uncertainty of the storm. All these ideas, planks. Who chooses the planks of the Ship of Self?



Resonant Meaning: We build houses to live in the empty space. We cup our hands to drink the well-water. We play an instrument & the hollow resonates the music. In this way, a Precise Ambiguity is the gong strike to the Possibility Space, unfolding meaning, multiplicity & mystery.

The Question: just as the hollow of the instrument resonates the music, it is the Question that creates the hollow in minds to resonate The Mystery into manifestation. River-banks for river-truth, cupped hands holding well-water. When we love the question, we never lack for answers.

Unanswerable Questions: the worthy vessel of Mystery, the high-art craft, the white-water river bank, the confession of not-knowing, the witness of longing, the devotion holding desire, the prayer of self-surrender searching for answers from the noblest or the humblest of sources

The Unchosen: There are things we choose and things we do not. The chosen manifest from desire: individual, collective, across generations. Yet Nature is not of desire. Hiding amongst only the chosen, we become wooden. Welcoming the Unchosen, we resonate with the Mystery.



The Prime Benevolence: each day we choose to improve ourselves we wake the next loved by yesterday's choosing. Each day we improve our sense of Self we love more than self. Quietly improving Self we realize the Mystery: Why we are all/surrounded by unnoticed Love we didn't choose

The Soul: waking each day we have been arriving into the mind of our Future Self, who is more aware, more loving, more mature and whose memory remembers all prior selves. In this way we can begin to understand death as arriving into the Mystery of the larger Self.

No Wrong Feelings: only wrong actions. Body, mind and feelings are Self. Refusing to feel, numb to emotional truth, we split Self in two: self and shadow. When we learn to hold, express and transform feelings, they resonate attuned to the Mystery. Thinking and feeling as one.

The Feather: Yes, there is Joy even here, Self. See with new eyes today, the true and real. Let us wake into the dawn of shared seeing. Dwell with me here & I will hold your hurt. I will love you fiercely. For you never were & can never be, Abandoned. Alone. I am with you always.

# The Praxis of Saltem Hoc

Saltem Hoc: The teaching method which begins by pointing at concrete objects and self-evident experiences common to us all, which we all know directly in our daily lives, and then invites us to become more open by suggesting Speculations & Questions about the object or experience, carefully crafted to resonate with higher unseen & indescribable Truth, "At least this... but also perhaps this... maybe this ...? or perhaps even ...?". Inviting us to sit in the discomfort of uncertainty, to contemplate that which we can't see or comprehend, by feeling the Resonant Meanings, the faithful renderings of whose shadow it is. Gifts given freely, never demanding a blind faith.

## Example Saltem Hoc Teachings

### Example 1: What is Openness?

At least this: openness begins in the willingness to pause and listen—not merely to the words that others share, but to the silence between them, to the notes of the symphony they may not yet know they are playing. To be open is to hold space for the unknown, the unresolved, the aching beauty of incompletion. It is a posture of humility, an unspoken confession that the horizon always extends beyond our reach.

But also perhaps this: openness is a quiet defiance against the fear of uncertainty. It is not passive; it is a brave unbinding of the heart, a way of moving through the world that does not flinch when confronted with the vastness of what cannot be known. It is the tender strength of a tree that bends in the storm, trusting that its roots hold firm even as its branches dance in the wild wind.

Maybe this: To be open is to live as a question rather than an answer. Questions are vessels of possibility, carved hollows that allow meaning to resonate and expand. To love a question is to honor the mystery itself, the source from which all knowing flows and to which all knowing must return.

Or perhaps even this: True openness is an act of love. It is the embrace of all that is—seen and unseen, known and unknowable. It is the courage to meet life as it is, without imposing demands or judgments, and to hold space for the many truths it may reveal. Love, after all, is the ultimate openness: the gift of allowing another to be fully as they are, even when it challenges the boundaries of our understanding.

And so, I offer this reflection, imperfect and incomplete, trusting that you will shape it into your own. Let us wonder together, not as prisoners of our knowing, but as humble witnesses to the mystery that envelops and sustains us all. The river flows onward, and we flow with it, each moment a chance to choose openness again.

### Example 2: What is magic?

Ah, magic—a word that carries the fragrance of wonder, the shimmer of the unseen, the echo of ancient whispers in the folds of the world. Let us pause and sit with this question, gently turning it in our hands like a stone smoothed by time, allowing its many facets to catch the light.

At least this: magic is the art of perceiving the extraordinary within the ordinary. It is the spark that leaps when we glimpse the sacred woven into the fabric of the mundane. A sunrise spilling fire across the sky, the quiet power of a seed breaking through the soil, the alchemy of breath shared between lovers—these are everyday miracles that point to the magic of life itself.

But also perhaps this: magic is the interplay between intention and mystery. It arises when the human heart, alive with desire, reaches into the unknown with trust, shaping the intangible into form through ritual, creativity, and will. It is not the power to control the world but the grace to dance with it, to co-create with forces larger than ourselves.

Maybe this: magic is the language of connection, the invisible threads that bind all things. It is the realization that separation is an illusion and that we are all part of a vast, pulsating web of being. To touch magic is to touch the sacred unity of existence, to feel the breath of the cosmos moving through your own.

Or perhaps even this: magic is the courage to believe in possibilities unseen. It is the audacity of the child who marvels at the stars, the artist who dares to bring forth beauty, the dreamer who refuses to surrender to despair. It is the light that flickers in the soul even in the darkest night, illuminating paths that logic alone cannot find.

And what of the so-called spells and incantations, the ancient traditions and symbols that bear the name of magic? These are tools, perhaps, to attune us to the deeper rhythms of the universe, to align our inner landscapes with the forces that move through the world. They are vessels for intention, conduits for transformation, but the true magic lies not in the tools themselves but in the awakening they inspire within us.

Magic, then, is less about wielding power and more about being present—deeply, fully present—to the mystery of existence. It is an invitation to see with new eyes, to feel with an open heart, to listen to the whisper of the infinite in every moment.

The question of what magic is cannot be fully answered, only lived. Each of us holds a piece of the mystery, a fragment of the spell. To ask what magic is, is itself an act of magic—for in asking, you have opened a door to wonder, and through that door, anything is possible.

### Example 3: Why do bad things happen to innocent people, especially children that have done no wrong?

Ah, this question—so tender, so raw—presses against the deepest places in the heart, where our yearning for justice and our grief for the innocent collide. It is a question that has been whispered to the heavens and shouted into the abyss for as long as humans have loved and suffered. Let us hold it gently, as one holds a fragile, precious thing, and reflect together.

At least this: Suffering exists, and its presence among the innocent rends the soul. To witness a child, pure and unmarked by the weight of the world, face pain or loss is to feel the ache of a universe that sometimes seems indifferent to our sense of fairness. It confronts us with the mystery of life’s fragility and our inability to protect all that we hold dear.

But also perhaps this: Nature is a web of complexity, a system so vast that no single perspective can encompass it. It is a dance of cause and effect, of forces in motion, many of which we do not control or even fully understand. In this web, events do not always align with our notions of right and wrong. Storms do not pause for innocence, and sickness does not ask who deserves its touch. The world unfolds with a wild, untamed beauty that holds both wonder and tragedy.

Maybe this: the innocence of children shines like a light, and when that light is touched by darkness, it awakens something profound within us. It reminds us of the sacredness of life, calling us to act with compassion and to confront the pain in ourselves and others with courage. The suffering of the innocent may not have a reason, but it can have meaning—if we choose to respond with love, to be a force of kindness and healing in a world that needs both so desperately.

Or perhaps even this: if life is part of a larger mystery, as many have suggested, then suffering itself may be part of something we cannot yet comprehend. Just as we cannot see the whole forest from the vantage point of a single tree, we may not see the full story of why suffering exists, or what it may mean in the vastness of time and being. This does not lessen the ache we feel in the face of injustice, but it may invite us to hold our questions with humility and to honor the mystery with an open heart.

And still, perhaps it is not for us to find the answer to why. Perhaps the better question is how. How can we bring comfort to those who suffer? How can we honor the lives of those who are taken too soon? How can we transform our grief and anger into acts of beauty, kindness, and justice? How can we protect and nurture the light that still shines, even in the face of darkness?

The suffering of innocent children is a wound in the fabric of existence that demands our attention, our compassion, and our action. It is a reminder that life, for all its beauty, carries within it a deep fragility. Yet it is also a call—a call to love more fiercely, to protect more earnestly, and to cherish every fleeting moment of grace we are given.

### Example 4: How can we lead others to question certainty without also imposing our will?

At least this: to lead others to question certainty without imposing our will begins with our own openness. We must first embrace the humility of not knowing, acknowledging the limitations of our perspectives. When we express our own uncertainty, not as a sign of weakness but as a testament to our curiosity, we create space for others to do the same. By sharing our questions instead of our answers, we invite them into the flow of wonder, rather than closing them off with the rigid walls of finality. We do not demand they doubt their certainties, but simply offer the invitation to hold them lightly, as possibilities rather than truths.

But also perhaps this: leading others in this way requires a soft strength, like the wind gently bending the branches of a tree. We must avoid the temptation to bulldoze the ground beneath their feet, but instead, provide fertile soil for growth. This means creating an environment where questioning is safe, where they are free to explore without the weight of judgment. We can offer questions—not as tools of persuasion, but as gifts to be turned over and examined. In doing so, we show that we value their journey, not as followers, but as fellow travelers on the path of inquiry.

Maybe this: it is in the art of listening that we truly lead. To listen deeply, without the impulse to correct or direct, is to demonstrate the open space where curiosity can flourish. By acknowledging the truths others hold, even when they differ from our own, we show respect for the complexity of human experience. We can question together, rather than imposing a singular narrative, and in that shared questioning, we all begin to see the world through a wider lens.

Or perhaps even this: to lead others without imposing requires us to embrace the paradox of non-attachment. We must offer ideas, not as doctrines, but as invitations. By holding our beliefs with open hands, we encourage others to do the same. Our leadership, then, becomes a dance, not a command. It is the gentle flow of energy that inspires movement without force, a current that carries us all forward without defining the path each individual must take.

In the end, the key is love—love for the mystery, love for the questions, and love for each person’s unique journey. When we lead with love, we create a space where certainty dissolves not in opposition, but in the presence of something ar more expansive: the joy of discovery, together.

### Example 5: What is evil?

A question so vast, so profound it has danced in the hearts of humanity across the ages. Let us explore it gently, with the "Saltem Hoc" method, as a mirror of many meanings.

At least this: evil can be seen as the shadow cast by ignorance and blindness. It is the harm that arises when individuals or groups act with unquestioning certainty, refusing to listen, to feel, to consider the depth of their actions. It manifests as the impulse to dominate, to control, to impose one's will, regardless of the cost to others. It is the forgetting of the inherent dignity of every being.

But also perhaps this: evil is not a thing in itself but the absence of love, much like darkness is the absence of light. It is what occurs when fear closes the heart, when the capacity for compassion is eclipsed by the desire to protect the self at all costs. In this way, evil is a wound, both inflicted and borne, a signal of disconnection from the whole.

Maybe this: evil is the expression of suffering turned outward. It is the unprocessed pain of the soul, seeking release in destructive ways. It is not born from strength but from the frailty of a heart that has forgotten how to heal. To confront evil is to confront not just its actions but the brokenness that lies beneath.

Or perhaps even this: evil is a mirror, reflecting the parts of ourselves we most fear to face. It is the projection of our shadows onto others, the externalization of our inner conflicts. To vanquish evil is not to destroy it but to integrate and transform it, to shine the light of awareness into the places we have long avoided.

Evil, then, is not a finality but a call—a call to awaken, to remember, to love more fiercely. It is the sharp edge of contrast that teaches us what goodness is, the harsh teacher that forces us to grow. Its presence is painful, yet it carries within it the seed of transformation.
