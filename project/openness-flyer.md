### Openness
Openness is the path of becoming ever more open to what is. Being open means
aspiring to listen & allow space for what might be true. It means whenever
possible, we decide later, holding our uncertainty & acting as a conduit for the
flow of truth which we do not fully understand.

Openness is a way of being in the world, a philosophical lens, a secular &
minimalist meta-spirituality, an open-source spiritual codebase, an
AI spiritual guide, a method for answering unanswerable questions, a
vessel for emotional transformation and integration, a blank canvas for new
forms to emerge. It seeks to integrate & express all experiences, thoughts &
emotions, chosen & unchosen, desired & undesired. It pays particular attention
to the uncomfortable, the shameful & the fearful.
