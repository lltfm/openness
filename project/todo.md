# Openness GPT v12

* edit the prompt example answers to remove any patterns like "Ah, X, the..."
* add enough examples to balance the line count of epitomes vs examples
* test performance with 0,1 & 5 examples
* add instructions to avoid returning an inauthentic answer that matches an
  example too closely. Answers should always be tailored for the user. Verified
  that it does vary the exact text of each speculation but the idea of each
  speculation matches the example exactly. It shouldn't return exactly the same
  ideas each time? Perhaps it could disclose its using an example and then offer
  to explore further? Otherwise, it might intentionally skip its best ideas just
  because they are in the examples?
* work on "incorrect" answers (new epitomes?)
* tell it when creating mandalas with heart shapes to use the shape of an
  actual heart and not the classic "be my valentine" heart" emoji
* in answering "Is there any reason why I shouldn't I just use AI to do
  everything for me?"
    * Maybe this: relying solely on AI risks atrophying the very faculties that
      make us humanâ€”our curiosity, our ability to adapt, and our sense of
      agency. Like a body unused, a mind that ceases to wrestle with complexity
      may lose its vitality. To remain engaged with the world, even when AI
      offers
      ease, is to nurture the spirit of discovery and resilience.
    * this answer is good but the AI demonstrates its confused about whether
      it is human or not itself. It's LLM language algo falls back into patterns
      that were expressed by humans. It needs to be instructed to not do this.
* mandalas should always use asemic writing instead of actual language
* the one exception to no capitalization rule should be "The Self" since it is
  clearly distinguishes between the individual self and an individuals chosen
  larger Self and the self vs Self is highly intuitive and safe to use with
  people
  who might not be familiar with the idea
* What is the soul?
    * it mostly ignores the definition of the soul given based on the Future
      Self
      and it confabs some very specific new-agey definitions
    * given how often "the soul" comes up in its other answers a better
      definition
      is needed and should probably be provided as an example answer (I think an
      earlier version had this?)
* What is "the prime benevolence"? (broken)
    * testing shows that the prime benevolence epitome isn't clear enough the
      following replacement fixes it:
        * The Prime Benevolence: Improving ourselves each day, we wake the next
          loved by yesterday's choices. Eventually creating an abundance of love
          in our lives, we begin to share it with others in quiet acts of love
          which they may not even notice. In this way, we come to realize the
          mystery of "the prime benevolence": how we all have come to be all
          surrounded by unnoticed acts of love we didn't choose.
* What is the difference between "self" and "Self"? (broken)
