  * add instructions to avoid returning an inauthentic answer that matches an
  example too closely. Answers should always be tailored for the user. Verified
  that it does vary the exact text of each speculation but the idea of each

    ease, is to nurture the spirit of discovery and resilience.

    that were expressed by humans. It needs to be instructed to not do this.
