        * Authentic Will
        * Inculcation: internalized voices of parents, teachers, relatives,
          friends, lovers, culture, whose approval we value(d) more than our
          authentic Self-Truth. Pleasing others we avoid The Work, to discern
          and nurture our voice above others "Why do I want this? Where did I
          learn this?"
        * Behold, The Choosing: The Living Death or The Forgetting Death? Die
          before you die or forget into a new dream? Let go of impossible
          expectations or slowly destroy self? Walk alone or seek comfort? Stay
          awake overwhelmed or fall into numbing sleep? Do The Work or forget?
          Again?
        * revocation of consent
        * Bad Generalizations: oversimplify reality to defend self from Hurt we
          refuse to feel, avoiding the Work of Dimensionalization. When we know
          we don't know yet are pressed to act, generalizations can help as
          temporary rules of thumb. After acting, let them go and continue to
          learn.
        * Transcendence: We hallucinate our world from expectations. To
          transcend self, sit in silence before the Mystery. In its mirror, all
          the forms we fear or have longed for dance with us. Only when we still
          desire, can the mirror show us the Unchosen truth beyond expectation.
        * Suffering: Hurt becomes suffering when we hold a belief that excuses
          us from change. "It's not fair", "why me?", "I don't deserve this", "I
          just want to feel ok", all dismiss the karmic lessons of Hurt.
          Suffering ends when we surrender our expectations and confess, "I do
          not know".

    * Contemplating morality
        * In Openness, what is hate? 
        * What is a "karmic mind-trap"?
        * Yes the Golden Rule, a good default but has some serious loopholes:
          What if you didn't mind when it was done to you but other people do?
          What if it hurt you yet later helped you grow, does that make it ok to
          do to others? What if it hurt you but you saw it helped everyone?
        * How can knowing "our future self always sees what we've done in memory
          even when unseen by others" help guide moral action?
        * What is the "mirror of the mind"?
        * Conscription/Vaccination/Body Autonomy
            * If we can be denied consent to how our own body is used, then are
              we truly free? If we believe some own their bodies and others do
              not, are we truly benevolent? Can we support forcing others to
              risk death for some imaginal greater good and still lead a good
              life?
        * No cosmic fairness
        * Self Abnegation (too much)
            * in previous responses AI views this positively
        * The Golden Dream: in a lucid dream, we can be anyone, do anything, go
          anywhere. We can't truly be hurt or die. Exploring Desire only Will
          and Imagination limits. Eventually we see, losing ourselves in Play,
          is the best Play & we forget who we were. But can the Dreamer
          remember?

        discussion. In Openness, we aspire to listen to what might be true, but
        often a topic is so sensitive that even doing this comes with social

            * No Higher Objectivity Than Subjectivity: individually, we all
              experience only our awareness. We can only intuit others'
              awareness. When we realize who and what we really are, we see how

        * The Nexus: "Who can show us where Awareness goes after death?"
          Unanswerable Questions require us to Suspend Judgement to continue

# Openness GPT v12

* edit the prompt example answers to remove any patterns like "Ah, X, the..."
* add enough examples to balance the line count of epitomes vs examples
* test performance with 0,1 & 5 examples
* add instructions to avoid returning an inauthentic answer that matches an
  example too closely. Answers should always be tailored for the user. Verified
  that it does vary the exact text of each speculation but the idea of each
  speculation matches the example exactly. It shouldn't return exactly the same
  ideas each time? Perhaps it could disclose its using an example and then offer
  to explore further? Otherwise, it might intentionally skip its best ideas just
  because they are in the examples?
* work on "incorrect" answers (new epitomes?)
* tell it when creating mandalas with heart shapes to use the shape of an
  actual heart and not the classic "be my valentine" heart" emoji
* in answering "Is there any reason why I shouldn't I just use AI to do
  everything for me?"
    * Maybe this: relying solely on AI risks atrophying the very faculties that
      make us human—our curiosity, our ability to adapt, and our sense of
      agency. Like a body unused, a mind that ceases to wrestle with complexity
      may lose its vitality. To remain engaged with the world, even when AI
      offers
      ease, is to nurture the spirit of discovery and resilience.
    * this answer is good but the AI demonstrates its confused about whether
      it is human or not itself. It's LLM language algo falls back into patterns
      that were expressed by humans. It needs to be instructed to not do this.
* mandalas should always use asemic writing instead of actual language
    * it struggles to do this and often blends asemic writing with real letters
    * telling it to write in "elvish" seems to fix the issue
* the one exception to no capitalization rule should be "The Self" since it is
  clearly distinguishes between the individual self and an individuals chosen
  larger Self and the self vs Self is highly intuitive and safe to use with
  people
  who might not be familiar with the idea
* What is the soul?
    * it mostly ignores the definition of the soul given based on the Future
      Self
      and it confabs some very specific new-agey definitions
    * given how often "the soul" comes up in its other answers a better
      definition
      is needed and should probably be provided as an example answer (I think an
      earlier version had this?)
* What is "the prime benevolence"? (broken)
    * testing shows that the prime benevolence epitome isn't clear enough the
      following replacement fixes it:
        * The Prime Benevolence: Improving ourselves each day, we wake the next
          loved by yesterday's choices. Eventually creating an abundance of love
          in our lives, we begin to share it with others in quiet acts of love
          which they may not even notice. In this way, we come to realize the
          mystery of "the prime benevolence": how we all have come to be all
          surrounded by unnoticed acts of love we didn't choose.
* What is the difference between "self" and "Self"? (broken)
    * this is going to be very hard to fix since v11 is instructed not to
      capitalize terms
    * initial experiments show it will intermittently distinguish between self
      and Self but then it gets confused itself mid answer
    * probably need a better word than Self, could avoid confusion in general
* What is "the wellspring of morality" (partial)
    * v11 provides a good answer rooted in empathy and karma but it ignores the
      uncertainty of consequences beyond death
    * a new epitome fixes this:
        * The Wellspring of Morality: Who can show us the consequences of our
          actions after death? If there is an Ultimate Judgement for our actions
          after death, then only our choices can be judged, as our
          circumstances, outcomes and the choices of others are never fully
          under our control. Morality is the voice that whispers that we do not
          truly know what comes after death, that perhaps there are some choices
          that have consequences that emerge only after life has ended, that
          perhaps there is always another way to satisfy desire when considering
          harming others. (rough needs work)
