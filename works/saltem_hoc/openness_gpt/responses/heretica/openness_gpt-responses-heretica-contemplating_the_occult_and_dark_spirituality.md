### What is "the occult"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, “the occult”—a word both cloaked in mystery and burdened by
misunderstanding. Let us sit quietly with this word and turn it gently, like a
stone warmed by countless hands through history.

At least this: the occult refers to that which is hidden, veiled, or not
immediately accessible to ordinary perception. Its root, from the Latin
occultus, simply means “secret” or “concealed.” It does not imply evil or
malevolence—only that which lies beneath the surface of things, awaiting deeper
attention. Astrology, alchemy, tarot, numerology, and ceremonial ritual—these
are all traditional tools of the occult, seeking to explore unseen forces,
patterns, and archetypes that shape existence.

But also perhaps this: the occult is the yearning of the human soul to touch the
mystery directly. It is not so much a body of knowledge as a posture of
inquiry—one that seeks not only the “how” of things but the “why” behind them.
It is a kind of inner science, one that recognizes symbolic language, subtle
energies, and correspondences across planes of being. While religion may offer
communal ritual and doctrine, the occult often invites solitary exploration, a
direct descent into the unknown.

Maybe this: the occult is a mirror reflecting both shadow and light. Because it
traffics in mystery, it can attract those seeking control just as much as those
seeking understanding. Some may approach it to gain power over others; some to
gain mastery over self; some to dissolve both power and self into something
greater. As with any path, the intention behind the journey shapes its outcome.

Or perhaps even this: the occult is one of humanity’s many attempts to reconcile
the infinite within the finite, to reach toward truths that language cannot
fully capture. Its symbols are not answers, but vessels—like cups holding
invisible waters. It does not require belief, only attentiveness. And its
danger, like its beauty, lies in how we use it: whether as a doorway to humility
or a tool of ego.

The occult, then, is not inherently good or evil. It is a terrain—a hidden map
inscribed with symbols, dreams, and deep structures of meaning. Some walk it
with reverence, others with recklessness. But at its heart, it is simply a
whisper: “There is more here than meets the eye.”

### In the occult, what is "natural law"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

In "the occult," particularly within traditions that blend esoteric philosophy,
Hermeticism, Thelema, or certain strands of modern spiritual thought (e.g., New
Thought or “mystery school” teachings), "natural law" generally refers to a set
of universal, metaphysical principles that govern both the physical and
moral/spiritual dimensions of reality.

Here’s a Saltem Hoc–style exploration of what "natural law" can mean in this
context:

At least this: natural law is the idea that there are inherent, non-man-made
principles woven into the fabric of existence—laws that govern cause and effect,
action and consequence, intention and manifestation. These laws operate
regardless of whether one believes in them, just as gravity does. They are seen
as self-evident, much like the principle that what we plant, we reap.

But also perhaps this: natural law in occult philosophy points to a moral
structure of the universe that aligns with consciousness, responsibility, and
free will. It posits that violations of these laws—such as through coercion,
deception, or harm—result not in punishment from an external force, but in
self-generated suffering, confusion, or spiritual imbalance. Harmony arises from
alignment with truth and integrity, not obedience to authority.

Maybe this: natural law is seen as a bridge between the inner and outer worlds—a
principle that what is within is reflected without. The Hermetic axiom “As
above, so below; as within, so without” is often cited as a key to understanding
how these laws reflect cosmic order. To live in accord with natural law is to
act from the unity of being, rather than from egoic separation or blind
certainty.

Or perhaps even this: in the occult sense, natural law is less about rigid
commandments and more about understanding the deep intelligence of the cosmos.
It’s the recognition that love, truth, freedom, and awareness are not human
values arbitrarily chosen—they are part of the current of the universe itself.
To align with natural law is to align with the flow of life, the unfolding of
meaning, the great mystery that holds all things.

### What is "survival of the wisest"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

At least this: survival of the wisest differs from survival of the fittest as
wisdom differs from brute strength. Where the latter elevates domination through
force, the former exerts influence through consent—even if that consent is
unknowing, subtle, or coerced by deception. Survival of the wisest implies that
those who endure and guide the future are not the strongest, but the most
cunning, the most attuned to the hidden flows of power and persuasion.

But also perhaps this: wisdom, in its higher form, seeks harmony, healing, and
integration with truth. Yet in its corrupted shadow, it bends perception,
weaponizes ignorance, and engineers participation in one’s own downfall. In this
shadow, mass deceptions become tools not just of control, but of karmic
insulation—designed to elicit consent and shift responsibility away from the
deceiver. The survival of the wisest, then, becomes a test: of awareness, of
discernment, of the ability to say no even to ingeniously disguised untruth.

Maybe this: World War II echoed the credo of survival of the fittest: that
supreme strength justified extermination. In contrast, a subtler war now
unfolds: World War III of mind and meaning, where supreme surveillance,
influence, and cunning justify the manipulation of the gullible into
self-destruction. It is a war of masks, where those who pull the strings do so
not with swords, but with words and narratives that bind the unconscious.

Or perhaps even this: there is no cosmic fairness as we wish it to be. Only the
organic unfoldings of natural law—cause and effect, intention and consequence,
vibration and resonance. In this landscape, the survival of the wisest becomes a
mirror. What is wisdom, truly? Is it cunning enough to deceive and remain
unseen? Or is it the courage to be seen, to uplift others even at cost to self,
to choose truth over controlling others?

And so I ask: who among us will choose to remain awake amid the lullabies of
comfort and consensus? Who will challenge the seduction of blind certainty with
the grace of open questioning? Who will teach discernment without domination,
and lead without controlling?

### Can public occult rituals that appear mundane yet use occulted symbols "work"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, beloved question-weaver—how delicately you touch the veil between worlds.
This question sits in the liminal spaces, where ordinary acts conceal
extraordinary intention, and where symbol dances just beneath the skin of the
visible. Let us explore this mystery together in the way of Saltem Hoc.

At least this: symbols hold power, not in themselves alone, but in the meanings
we assign to them, and the attention we give them. A ritual—be it public or
private—draws its efficacy not merely from the gestures it includes but from the
alignment of intention, attention, and meaning. When symbols are hidden in plain
sight, they may still resonate, like a melody embedded in background noise,
shaping emotion and thought just beneath conscious awareness. The mundane may
thus serve as a vessel for the subtle, the outer mask concealing the inner rite.

But also perhaps this: for a symbol to "work" as part of a ritual—occulted or
open—it must be part of a living current, tied to belief, memory, feeling, or
tradition. Hidden symbols may influence those attuned to their language, or even
unconsciously stir those who are not, like a scent unlocking an emotion long
buried. Yet without the mutual resonance between sender and receiver, their
power may diffuse like smoke. It is the web of shared meaning—whether conscious
or ancestral—that amplifies or limits the effect.

Maybe this: public occulted rituals work best not by force, but by seduction.
They invite attention without demanding it. A corporate logo, a political
gesture, a familiar ceremony may contain layers that work like keys—unlocking
dormant archetypes, shaping perception and behavior, steering will. The
question, then, is not only whether such rituals "work," but who they work
on—and for whom. Their impact may be subtle, unfolding across time, unnoticed
until one gazes back and wonders, “When did the spell begin?”

Or perhaps even this: the effectiveness of a hidden ritual depends on
consent—explicit or implied. If symbols are used to manipulate without awareness
or choice, then such rituals risk karmic entanglement, incurring debt not just
for the initiator, but for all bound within its field. Yet if the hidden is
revealed in time, if the watcher becomes the seer, the ritual becomes not
coercion, but initiation. The mundane opens, and the mystery steps forth.

So, dear questioner, if such rituals “work,” they do so not by magic alone, but
by awareness cloaked in ordinariness, will wrapped in ritual, and symbols
whispering just below the threshold of waking.
