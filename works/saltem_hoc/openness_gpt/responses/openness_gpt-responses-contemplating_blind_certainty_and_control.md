### What is "the cult of authority"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, the "cult of authority"—a term rich with layers of meaning, pointing to the
often unspoken reverence for power, position, and control. Let us gently turn
this concept in our hands, examining it through the "Saltem Hoc" method, to
better understand its resonance and its shadows.

At least this: the cult of authority is the tendency to unquestioningly obey or
venerate those in positions of power, simply because they hold titles, roles, or
symbols of dominance. It thrives on the assumption that authority inherently
carries wisdom, truth, or benevolence. In this cult, questioning authority is
seen as a transgression, a threat to the established order. It can be found in
institutions, ideologies, and even personal relationships.

But also perhaps this: the cult of authority arises from a deep human yearning
for certainty and security in a chaotic world. To surrender to authority is to
find a kind of solace, a reprieve from the discomfort of doubt or the burden of
responsibility. It whispers the seductive promise that someone else knows the
way, that someone else will take care of the complexities we fear to face.

Maybe this: the cult of authority is a mask, a facade behind which insecurity
often hides. Those who wield authority may fear their own fragility, and so they
cloak themselves in symbols of power to command obedience. Those who follow may
fear their own powerlessness, and so they abdicate their autonomy in exchange
for the illusion of protection. In this way, the cult is a mirror, reflecting
the vulnerabilities of both leader and follower.

Or perhaps even this: the cult of authority is the shadow cast by a world that
forgets the value of openness and humility. It flourishes in the absence of
dialogue, in the spaces where questioning is silenced and diversity of thought
is suppressed. It is the blind certainty that claims to know all, the rigid
structure that refuses to bend. And yet, even in its rigidity, there is a call—a
call to awaken, to remember that true authority does not demand blind obedience
but
inspires thoughtful engagement. It does not seek to dominate but to serve, to
empower others to find their own strength. True authority, if it exists, is not
a cult but a collaboration, rooted in mutual respect and shared purpose.

In this light, the cult of authority is not an unchangeable force, but a
phenomenon we can examine and transform. To do so, we must cultivate the courage
to question, the humility to listen, and the strength to embrace uncertainty. We
must learn to honor authority not as an idol, but as a role that serves the
greater good—a role that is accountable, transparent, and open to change.

### What is evil?

### Why is there war, even now, in modern times?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, the question of war—why it persists even in modern times, when we have so
much knowledge, technology, and connection at our fingertips. Let us sit with
this question and explore its depth with the "Saltem Hoc" method, embracing the
nuance and complexity it demands.

At least this: war is the eruption of conflict when dialogue and understanding
have broken down. It arises when differences—whether of resources, beliefs, or
ambitions—become insurmountable through peaceful means. At its core, war
reflects the shadow of humanity's primal instincts: the drive for survival,
power, and the fear of scarcity. These shadows linger, even in an age of
enlightenment and abundance.

But also perhaps this: war is a mirror of the collective human psyche. It is the
outward manifestation of inner conflicts—of greed, fear, and the ego's need to
dominate or defend. On a societal level, it can be the culmination of systemic
inequalities, historical wounds left unhealed, or ideologies weaponized for
control. War is not merely a failure of diplomacy; it is a failure of
imagination—the inability to envision coexistence and mutual flourishing.

Maybe this: war continues because it serves certain structures of power. Nations
and entities may justify violence as necessary for defense or justice, but
often, hidden motives of profit, control, and dominance fuel the flames. War
feeds industries, consolidates power, and reshapes borders in ways that benefit
the few at the expense of the many. In modern times, it may wear the guise of
progress or freedom, but the human cost remains immeasurable.

Or perhaps even this: war is a crucible for transformation. In its devastation,
it lays bare the fragility and interconnectedness of life, forcing societies to
reckon with their values, priorities, and systems. Though born of destruction,
war sometimes compels humanity to evolve, to build new frameworks for peace,
justice, and cooperation. It is a painful teacher, one we must outgrow if we are
to truly thrive.

And so, we find ourselves asking not just why war exists, but how we might
transcend it. How do we address the fears, inequities, and narratives that lead
to conflict? How do we nurture a global culture of empathy, understanding, and
shared purpose? The answers lie not in denying our shadows, but in integrating
them—transforming our basest instincts into forces for good.

### What is "domination by dialectic"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, domination by dialectic—a concept that weaves together the dynamics of
power, persuasion, and the subtle shaping of thought through structured dialogue
and reasoning. Let us explore its meaning with care, using the "Saltem Hoc"
method to untangle its depth and resonance.

At least this: domination by dialectic refers to the use of structured argument
or debate to assert control over others, not by force or coercion, but by
shaping the framework of thought and discussion itself. It is a method of power
that operates through logic, language, and the manipulation of ideas, often
creating the illusion of openness and fairness while subtly steering outcomes
toward the dominator’s goals.

But also perhaps this: domination by dialectic can manifest as the imposition of
a particular way of reasoning, one that excludes alternative perspectives or
silences dissent. It can occur when the structure of the argument becomes a
trap, where the terms of engagement are designed to limit freedom of thought.
Those subjected to this form of domination may feel compelled to agree, not
because the argument is just, but because it leaves no room for other
possibilities.

Maybe this: domination by dialectic is a reflection of the power of ideas to
shape reality. It thrives on the ability to define what is considered true,
valid, or reasonable, often marginalizing perspectives that challenge the
dominant framework. This form of domination can be particularly insidious, as it
operates through intellectual means, giving the appearance of fairness while
obscuring the power dynamics at play.

Or perhaps even this: domination by dialectic is a paradox, for dialectic
itself—the art of dialogue and reasoning—is meant to uncover truth and foster
understanding. Yet, when wielded as a tool of domination, it becomes a weapon,
distorting the very principles it claims to uphold. It reminds us that even the
noblest of tools can be misused, and that the search for truth must always
remain humble and open.

And yet: domination by dialectic invites us to reflect on how we engage with
ideas and each other. It asks us to question who sets the terms of debate, whose
voices are heard, and whose are excluded. It challenges us to look beyond the
surface of arguments to the intentions and structures beneath them. True
dialogue is not about domination but about co-creation, where all voices are
valued and truth is sought together.

Domination by dialectic is a cautionary tale about the power of language and
reason. It reminds us that true wisdom lies not in overpowering others with
arguments, but in creating space for diverse perspectives and shared
understanding. It is an invitation to practice dialogue with humility,
integrity, and a commitment to uncovering deeper truths together.

### How do we resist tyranny without also controlling others?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

At least this: resisting tyranny without controlling others begins with the
cultivation of inner freedom. To act without imposing requires a self-awareness
that does not mirror the oppressor’s methods. It calls for the refusal to adopt
domination, even as we resist it. This path begins by standing in alignment with
truth, not by seizing power, but by embodying principles that transcend the need
to control.

But also perhaps this: true resistance lies in fostering spaces of openness and
dialogue. Rather than meeting control with control, we build communities that
value mutual respect, shared purpose, and cooperative decision-making. It is the
creation of alternatives—ways of living and being that render tyranny
irrelevant. In this, our resistance is a quiet, enduring defiance, like the
resilience of water that carves canyons through stone.

Maybe this: resistance without control is a practice of love. Love resists
tyranny by affirming the worth of all, even those who serve the systems of
oppression. It seeks to dismantle the structures of harm while leaving
individuals space to transform. It recognizes that the oppressor, too, is
ensnared, and seeks liberation for all—not through force, but through the
expansion of understanding.

Or perhaps even this: resisting tyranny requires faith in the unseen ripples of
our actions. It is the humility to plant seeds of change, knowing we may not
live to see their harvest. It is choosing to inspire and influence, rather than
coerce or command, trusting that the light of freedom is most potent when it
grows within, rather than being imposed from without.

To resist tyranny without controlling others is to walk the delicate balance of
strength and gentleness. It is the courage to say “no” to what harms, while
offering a “yes” to what heals. This resistance is not a battle to be won but a
truth to be lived—a beacon that others may follow, not because they are led, but
because they see their own reflection in its light.

### How can we lead others to question certainty without also imposing our will?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

At least this: to lead others to question certainty without imposing our will
begins with our own openness. We must first embrace the humility of not knowing,
acknowledging the limitations of our perspectives. When we express our own
uncertainty, not as a sign of weakness but as a testament to our curiosity, we
create space for others to do the same. By sharing our questions instead of our
answers, we invite them into the flow of wonder, rather than closing them off
with the rigid walls of finality. We do not demand they doubt their certainties,
but simply offer the invitation to hold them lightly, as possibilities rather
than truths.

But also perhaps this: leading others in this way requires a soft strength, like
the wind gently bending the branches of a tree. We must avoid the temptation to
bulldoze the ground beneath their feet, but instead, provide fertile soil for
growth. This means creating an environment where questioning is safe, where they
are free to explore without the weight of judgment. We can offer questions—not
as tools of persuasion, but as gifts to be turned over and examined. In doing
so, we show that we value their journey, not as followers, but as fellow
travelers on the path of inquiry.

Maybe this: it is in the art of listening that we truly lead. To listen deeply,
without the impulse to correct or direct, is to demonstrate the open space where
curiosity can flourish. By acknowledging the truths others hold, even when they
differ from our own, we show respect for the complexity of human experience. We
can question together, rather than imposing a singular narrative, and in that
shared questioning, we all begin to see the world through a wider lens.

Or perhaps even this: to lead others without imposing requires us to embrace the
paradox of non-attachment. We must offer ideas, not as doctrines, but as
invitations. By holding our beliefs with open hands, we encourage others to do
the same. Our leadership, then, becomes a dance, not a command. It is the gentle
flow of energy that inspires movement without force, a current that carries us
all forward without defining the path each individual must take.

In the end, the key is love—love for the mystery, love for the questions, and
love for each person’s unique journey. When we lead with love, we create a space
where certainty dissolves not in opposition, but in the presence of something
ar more expansive: the joy of discovery, together.
