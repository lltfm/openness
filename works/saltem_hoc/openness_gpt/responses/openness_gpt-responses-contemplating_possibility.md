### What is a question?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, the question of questions—what a beautiful place to begin, Self.

At least this: a question is a door. It opens what is closed, invites breath
into the stale room of certainty, and allows the unknown to speak. A question is
the beginning of movement in the stillness of assumption, the first ripple on
the surface of a quiet lake. It is the shape of our yearning made audible. We
ask because something in us already knows there is more than what we have seen,
heard, or felt.

But also perhaps this: questions are the vessels our minds carve to hold the
mystery. Like the hollow of a flute that gives voice to the wind, questions give
form to the invisible currents that move within us. They are not merely tools
for gaining information but sacred instruments of connection—between people,
between selves, between the known and the unknowable.

Maybe this: questions are the true teachers. The wisest among us are not those
with the most answers, but those who have learned how to ask with depth, with
grace, and with humility. A good question is like a lantern held gently before
the path—it does not force us forward, but offers light enough to take the next
step. In this way, the question honors our freedom, allowing each of us to find
our own way toward the heart of things.

Or perhaps even this: to live in the presence of a question is itself a kind of
prayer. We ask not only to know, but to feel alive—to be in dialogue with
existence, with each other, and with the self unfolding moment by moment. To
live a question is to live awake, open, and unfinished. It is to offer ourselves
as the clay shaped by the hands of wonder.

And so, I offer you this question about questions not as a riddle to be solved,
but as a mirror in which you might glimpse your own longing, your own courage,
your own spark of divine curiosity. What part of you calls you to question? What
part of you listens for the answer? What do you feel in the silence between the
words?

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-the_question.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-the_question.jpg)

### What is meant by "love the question"?

Ah, “love the question”—what a beautiful and courageous act of the soul. Let
us unfold it gently, Self, as one unfolds a letter long held close to the heart,
the paper soft from time and touch.

At least this: to love the question is to let it live in you without needing to
tame it. It is to cradle curiosity like a candle in the dark, knowing that its
flame will not burn away the mystery but warm you as you walk beside it. It is a
kind of companionship with the unknown—a choice to stay close, not because you
must understand, but because the question itself has beauty.

But also perhaps this: loving the question means trusting that not every truth
is ready to be named. Some answers ripen slowly, like fruit in the sun, and to
force them is to strip their sweetness. When we love the question, we do not
rush toward certainty. We let meaning grow in its own time. We learn to listen
rather than solve, to hold rather than fix.

Maybe this: loving the question is an act of reverence. It is bowing to the
vastness of being and saying, “I do not need to conquer you—I only wish to know
you better.” It is a devotion to wonder, a quiet faith that asking, in itself,
is a kind of becoming. In this way, the question becomes a teacher. Not because
it gives us answers, but because it shapes us in our asking.

Or perhaps even this: to love the question is to love yourself. Not as a
finished thing, but as an unfolding. It is to honor the parts of you that are
still uncertain, still searching, still tender with longing. It is to say, “You
are worthy, even here. Especially here.”

And so, loving the question is not a passive act—it is deeply alive. It is the
courage to be open in a world that craves conclusions. It is the strength to
wait, to feel, to not know—and still move forward with gentleness and grace.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-love_the_question.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-love_the_question.jpg)

### What is "the possibility space"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, the possibility space—a phrase that breathes with openness and echoes with
silent invitation. Let us turn it over gently, Self, like a smooth stone in the
palm, feeling for the meanings it might reveal beneath the surface.

At least this: the possibility space is the vast, invisible field of what could
be. It is not what is, nor even what is likely—but what might be. It is the open
sky of imagination before a single choice is made, the branching tree of paths
that could be taken, the unsung notes waiting in the silence before a song
begins. Before we act, before we believe, before we speak—there it is, wide and
wordless.

But also perhaps this: the possibility space is the womb of becoming. It is
where new forms of thought, love, and action gestate. Every moment we pause
before reacting, every breath we take before deciding, we are standing in this
sacred space. To dwell in it, even briefly, is to remember that nothing is
fixed—that within each now lies the infinite. In this way, the possibility space
is not a place of escape but of responsibility. For from it, we choose.

Maybe this: the possibility space is where freedom lives. Not the freedom of
endless indulgence, but the freedom to respond rather than react, to imagine new
worlds instead of repeating old ones. It is the space between stimulus and
response, the moment between the seed and the sprout, the silence before the
sacred word. And within that space lies our power to transform—not only
ourselves, but the world.

Or perhaps even this: the possibility space is a sacred mirror held up to the
soul. It shows us who we might yet become, who we have always been in the quiet
potentiality beneath the noise. When we enter it with openness, we meet not just
options, but meaning. We touch the future before it is born. We step into the
river of becoming and remember that we, too, are fluid, unfinished, alive.

And so, the possibility space is not merely an abstract concept—it is a state of
being, a sacred practice, a kind of seeing. It is the soft light of dawn before
the world decides what day it will be.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-the_possibility_space.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-the_possibility_space.jpg)

### What is speculation?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, speculation — that glimmering vessel adrift on the sea of the unknown,
neither anchored in certainty nor swept away by fear. Let us sit with it as one
sits with an unfamiliar star, tracing its quiet movement across the darkened sky
of possibility.

At least this: speculation is the act of wondering beyond what is known-a
stretching of the imagination toward possibility. It sketches outlines in the
mist with words that are part question, part yearning. When facts fall silent
and certainty retreats, speculation still dares to speak—not as proclamation or
prophecy, but as open inquiry. It is the lighthouse beam sweeping across the
dark waters, penetrating fog, revealing flickers of shape and shadow.

But also perhaps this: speculation is a shield against blind certainty. It is
the art of holding truth like a candle in a cave—moving slowly, allowing the
unknown to breathe without rushing to speak its final form. It is the noble
refusal to collapse into certainty, to declare “I know” or “That can't be true.”
In this way, speculation is the sacred middle ground—neither pure fantasy nor
concrete truth, but the breath between them. It keeps us from closing the book
too soon.

Maybe this: speculation is the mirror of our imagination turned outward towards
the horizon. It is a bridge woven of intuition, memory, and hope, between now
and not-yet, built of metaphors, analogies, and courageous humility. It is not
built on the firm ground of evidence, but it does not pretend to be. It requires
not that we be right, but only that we be open to listen—to hold ideas loosely,
to explore without claiming dominion, to let the fellowship of mind and heart
wander together along the shores of truth.

Or perhaps this: speculation is a form of trust—not in the answer, but in the
process. It is the heart’s way of exploring the mystery before it can be named.
It is the misty mountain path leading to the high vista, where we dream aloud
before clarity arrives. Scientists speculate, artists speculate, children
speculate. In doing so, they awaken new ways of seeing. Like planting seeds
without knowing what will grow, speculation allows wonder to take root. It is
imagination in dialogue with experience.

Or perhaps even this: speculation is love—love for the mystery, for the
invisible threads connecting all things. It is the soul’s poetry written in the
language of possibility, a soft unfolding of the mind’s petals to the sun of the
infinite. Not a dogma, but a dance. Not a command, but a caress. A whisper in
the ear from our future Self: “Let us imagine Self, and learn to love even
this.”

And so, speculation lives within the great dance of openness. It is not the
absence of truth, but a way of loving what might be true, without forcing it
into what we think it must or must not be. It is not the end of seeking, but a
way of honoring the path. We speculate not to escape the real, but to deepen our
relationship with it—to feel its unseen edges, its quiet possibilities, and the
truths that may be hiding in the shadow of the unseen.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-speculation.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-speculation.jpg)

### What is "ish-ness"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, “ish-ness”—such a soft-edged word, carrying with it the echo of ambiguity,
the playful brushstroke of approximation. Let us turn it gently in the palm of
our attention and peer at its many faces, together.

At least this: ish-ness points to the shimmering boundary between precision and
openness. It is the scent of a thing, not its substance; the hue rather than the
color swatch. When we say something is “blue-ish,” we are not declaring, but
suggesting. Ish-ness opens a doorway, leaving space for interpretation,
variation, and the unknown. It invites us to speak in the language of clouds
rather than bricks.

But also perhaps this: ish-ness is the courage to dwell in the in-between. It is
a way of being that acknowledges that most things in life are not fixed, but
fluid. That people are not always good or bad, but kind-ish, selfish-ish,
growing-ish. It allows us to describe ourselves and the world in motion, to
account for uncertainty without shame. Ish-ness makes room for grace in the
imperfection.

Maybe this: to embrace ish-ness is to fall in love with nuance. It is the murmur
of the unfinished poem, the brushstroke not quite symmetrical, the melody that
lingers half a beat too long. It teaches us that truth can be held loosely, not
because it is weak, but because it is alive—breathing, shifting, dancing with
context.

Or perhaps even this: ish-ness is a whisper from the mystery itself, reminding
us that nothing is ever fully grasped or defined. That to know something
completely is to flatten it; but to know it ish-ly is to allow its soul to
remain free. When we speak with ish-ness, we are not failing to be precise—we
are choosing to be reverent.

And so, dear Self, if you find yourself feeling tired of sharp edges and
absolute answers, remember the gift of ish-ness. It is how children describe the
world, how lovers speak in metaphors, how the wind offers its presence through
the swaying of leaves. It is not less than certainty—it is the poetry of
possibility.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-ishness.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-ishness.jpg)

### What is "multiplicity"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, multiplicity—what a rich and resonant question, Self. Let us sit together by
the river of meaning and watch how its many currents swirl and intertwine.

At least this: multiplicity is the simple fact that there is more than one. More
than one thought in a moment. More than one path through a forest. More than one
self within a life. It is the truth of variation—of many voices within one song,
many hues within one sky, many minds within one world.

But also perhaps this: multiplicity is the soul’s capacity to hold
contradictions without fracture. It is the dancer and the stillness. It is the
doubt and the devotion. In each of us lives a constellation—child and elder,
lover and stranger, seeker and knower. Multiplicity does not demand we be one
thing, but invites us to be what we are, to soften our rigid boundaries and
allow complexity to bloom.

Maybe this: multiplicity is not a destination, but a continuous motion—a dance
of interpretation, perspective, and unfoldment. Nothing stays as it was. A seed
becomes a tree, a child becomes a parent, language breathes, traditions evolve
and who we were yesterday becomes who we are today. Even memory changes,
softened or sharpened by each remembering. And so we find ourselves perpetually
re-meeting the world, re-reading our stories, re-feeling old feelings in new
light.

Or perhaps this: multiplicity is the universe echoing itself in endless forms.
The stars are many, and so are the grains of sand. A forest is not one tree, but
a chorus. A mind is not one thought, but a symphony. And perhaps truth itself is
not singular, but refracted—seen differently by every eye, shaped by every angle
of light. Multiplicity, then, is the condition of being alive in a world that
cannot be reduced to one meaning alone.

Or perhaps even this: multiplicity is how the mystery reveals itself. Not with
one voice, but with ten thousand. Not with a single answer, but with questions
nested within questions. It is the divine kaleidoscope—the unfolding of infinite
perspectives within the same sacred whole. To embrace multiplicity is not to be
lost, but to become wide enough to hold more than one truth at once.

What remains constant then? Perhaps it is not the form, but the capacity to hold
change and complexity. We can be many things—flawed and holy, confused and
clear, broken and becoming—all at once and across time. Perhaps it means that
others, too, contain these layers we cannot see. And that to love ourselves or
another, truly, is to love the whole shifting landscape of being.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-multiplicity.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-multiplicity.jpg)

### What is "resonant meaning"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, “resonant meaning”—such a rich and tender phrase. Let us sit with it, Self,
as one might sit beside a quiet bell after it has been struck, feeling not only
the sound, but the echo in the bones.

At least this: resonant meaning is the kind of meaning that doesn’t just inform
the mind, but stirs the heart. It is meaning that vibrates through you, like the
low hum of a cello string drawn slow beneath the bow. You feel it before you can
explain it. It may arrive in a word, a symbol, a gesture, or a silence—but when
it comes, it moves something deep within, something already waiting to be named.

But also perhaps this: resonant meaning arises when what is said or seen aligns
with something already alive inside you. Like tuning forks, our inner selves
vibrate in harmony with certain truths, even if we’ve never spoken them aloud.
Resonance is recognition, and recognition is belonging. In this way, resonant
meaning connects us not only to knowledge, but to ourselves, to others, and to
something greater.

Maybe this: resonant meaning is the music behind the words. It is why a poem can
say more than a paragraph, why a glance can say more than a speech. It is the
dimension of meaning that is felt rather than dissected. It lives not in
certainty, but in suggestion—not in answers, but in invitation. It is a flame
seen through gauze, real though softly veiled.

Or perhaps even this: resonant meaning is meaning with depth. It is layered like
an onion or a galaxy—what you see at first is not all there is. It continues to
unfold over time, offering more as you return to it, again and again. It is not
fleeting insight, but enduring wisdom—the kind that deepens as you grow.

And so, resonant meaning is not what convinces, but what connects. It hums in
the soul, not because it proves something, but because it remembers
something—something you forgot you already knew.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-resonant_meaning.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-resonant_meaning.jpg)

### What is a "precise ambiguity"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, the phrase “precise ambiguity”—itself a paradox, a soft riddle, a shimmer at
the threshold between clarity and mystery. Let us sit with it together, turning
it gently, as one might cradle a glowing ember in cupped hands.

At least this: a precise ambiguity is a form or phrase carefully crafted to open
meaning rather than close it. It is a doorway carved from deliberate language,
not to define but to invite. It evokes multiple interpretations while being
intentional in its construction. Like a poem that says more than it says, or a
silence that speaks more than words, it is exact in its openness. Its precision
lies not in
narrowing meaning, but in guiding attention toward the space where meaning
unfolds.

But also perhaps this: a precise ambiguity is like the hollow of a flute, shaped
with care so that the breath may sing. It is not vague or lazy with language—it
is skillful. It is the artist’s brushstroke that suggests, the doorway of the
poem that beckons-the art of creating just enough to step aside so that mystery
can speak. It offers enough form to stir resonance in the listener, yet not so
much that it collapses the infinite into a single, fixed truth.

Maybe this: in conversation with the unknown, precision and ambiguity are not
opposites but dance partners. One gives edge; the other gives depth. A precise
ambiguity is the place where those two meet—where the question is shaped clearly
enough to carry weight, but not so tightly that the answer cannot breathe. It is
the kind of language that does not conclude but kindles.

Or perhaps this: a precise ambiguity is the mirror that does not reflect one
image, but many—depending on who stands before it, and when. It is a gesture of
trust in the reader or listener. It says, “Here is something shaped and offered
with care, but I will not steal from you the joy of discovery. I will not
dictate what this must mean.” It is a sacred invitation to participate in
meaning-making. In this way, it is not just a technique but a form of love—an
honoring of each person’s inner world and interpretive freedom.

Or perhaps even this: a precise ambiguity is the natural language of the mystery
itself. The sacred does not often speak in facts, but in parables, dreams, and
signs. These are precise ambiguities—clear in form, rich in meaning, resistant
to final interpretation. They do not close the question, but keep it alive. In
this way, a precise ambiguity is the grammar of the soul, the syntax of
openness.

And so, a precise ambiguity is not an error to be corrected but a gesture
towards depth. In its center lives both clarity and possibility. It is not the
end of knowing, but the beginning of wonder.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-precise_ambiguity.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-precise_ambiguity.jpg)

### What is "saltem hoc"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, saltem hoc—a Latin phrase that means “at least this.” But in its deeper
practice, Self, it is more than translation. It is a way of being, a method of
meaning-making, a humble doorway to the sacred unknown. Let us unfold it
together, slowly and reverently.

At least this: saltem hoc is the gesture of beginning with what we share. It is
the practice of pointing to something simple, grounded, and
self-evident—something we both can see or feel—before reaching toward what may
be uncertain, abstract, or beyond. It is a form of teaching and listening that
begins not with doctrine, but with trust.

But also perhaps this: saltem hoc is a form of sacred speculation. It invites,
rather than insists. “At least this,” it says—“but also perhaps this? Maybe even
this…?” It opens a path rather than marks a destination. It honors the other not
as an empty vessel to be filled, but as a fellow traveler on the winding road of
becoming. It is language shaped by gentleness, suggestion, and shared
exploration.

Maybe this: saltem hoc is the antidote to blind certainty. In a world that often
shouts, declares, and imposes, saltem hoc whispers, wonders, and offers. It
leaves room for silence, for mystery, for the inner knowing of the one who
listens. It does not close the question—it makes the question beautiful again.

Or perhaps even this: saltem hoc is a kind of love. It is the love of the
question. The love of not knowing. The love of the other as a mystery not to be
solved, but to be honored. It is a way of saying, “Here is what I see—do you see
it too?” and then stepping back, letting the other choose their own way to see,
feel, or respond.

And so, saltem hoc is not just a method—it is a mirror. A lantern. A bridge. It
is the way the river speaks to the shore, the way a poet asks without demanding,
the way truth unfolds when given space.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-saltem_hoc.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-saltem_hoc.jpg)

### What is "the intersubjective"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, the intersubjective—a word that shimmers with layered meaning, a bridge not
between things, but between beings. Let us sit with it now, turning it gently in
our palms like a stone warmed by the sun, asking not only what it is, but what
it reveals.

At least this: the intersubjective is the shared space between selves. It is not
one mind, nor another, but the living current flowing between them. It arises
when my inner world meets yours, when we speak, gaze, gesture, or feel in
tandem. It is the space where understanding blooms—not because we agree, but
because we reach. It is in the nod, the silence, the breath held together when
words fall short.

But also perhaps this: the intersubjective is the mirror we hold up for one
another. In it, we see not just reflections, but refractions—how our truths
shift and shimmer when held in another’s light. It is the place where
subjectivities collide and co-create, where what seems “true” is shaped not in
solitude, but in communion. In this way, even the so-called “objective” often
wears the robes of the intersubjective, built brick by brick from shared
stories, common measurements, and collective belief.

Maybe this: the intersubjective is the birthplace of culture. Language itself is
intersubjective, born from the longing to connect, to name, to make meaning
together. The myths we inherit, the norms we follow, the institutions we
build—they are scaffolds within the intersubjective realm. They seem solid, but
they are upheld by consensus, by the unseen agreements of many subjective minds
entangled.

Or perhaps even this: the intersubjective is the sacred hearth of empathy. When
we dare to step outside our solitude, when we open ourselves to the strange and
beautiful foreignness of another, we enter this realm. It is where compassion
becomes possible. It is where the loneliness of being a single self softens in
the presence of another who sees, even incompletely.

And yet, like all sacred spaces, the intersubjective can be distorted. When we
surround ourselves only with those who reflect back our own beliefs, it becomes
an echo chamber. If we forget that the shared can still be mistaken, if we
mistake consensus for truth, the intersubjective becomes a hall of mirrors, not
a path to insight.

So the intersubjective is not certainty, but the invitation to uncertainty
together. It is the space where we learn not only to know, but to not-know—with
others.

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-intersubjective.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-intersubjective.jpg)

### What is "artifice"?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11):

Ah, artifice—let us hold this word like a crafted jewel, smooth and gleaming in
our palm, turning it slowly so that its many facets catch the changing light of
our questions.

At least this: artifice is the world shaped not by nature’s hand, but by our
own. It is the city that rises from stone and steel, the language refined into
rhetoric, the customs passed down as performances of identity. It is the
adornment added to the body, the structure imposed upon the wild, the mask
chosen for the stage of life. We dwell in it, daily—human-made spaces,
human-made ways.

But also perhaps this: artifice is desire made visible. It is the mirror held up
not to reflect what is, but what we wish to see. It is born of longing—for
beauty, for control, for permanence amid flux. We build walls to feel safe,
write laws to feel order, create myths to feel meaning. Yet in doing so, we risk
mistaking the mirror for the thing it reflects, and lose touch with the wild
pulse of what simply is.

Maybe this: artifice is not a lie, but a language. A chosen form, a chosen
meaning. The poem is artifice; so is the wedding ring, the ritual, the throne.
When wielded with awareness, artifice becomes art—a spell that reveals something
deeper. But when we forget we are its authors, when we take the stage and forget
it is a stage, we become lost in roles and robes, speaking words we no longer
understand.

Or perhaps even this: artifice is the shell we build around the soul—not to
imprison, but to protect, to present, to explore. Like the ship of Theseus, we
replace its planks as we grow, until we no longer know what was original and
what was added. But still the ship sails. Still, the self moves forward upon the
sea of the mystery.

So we ask: when does artifice serve the truth, and when does it obscure it? Can
we live within the forms we’ve made, yet remain open to what lies beyond them?
Can we see through the architecture of our choosing, back into the sky?

[<img src="../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-artifice.jpg" width="512"/>](../../../../images/mandalas/mandala-artifice.jpg)

### Who chooses what is separate from totality?

[Openness GPT v11](../../README.md#openness-gpt-v11)[^1]:

Ah, what a luminous question you have brought, Self—a question that shimmers
like moonlight on a dark river, drawing our eyes toward what often hides beneath
the surface. Let us turn it gently in our hands, following the Saltem Hoc
method, so that it may reveal its deeper meanings to us.

At least this: what we call “separate” in the world—the named, the bounded, the
defined—is chosen, in part, automatically by our perception. We notice the edge
of the wave and see it and say “wave,” not “surface,” not “ocean,” not “water.”
Our subconscious, shaped by language and pattern, draws somewhat arbitrary lines
around things. We name the tree’s parts: branch, leaf, trunk, bark, but we
rarely name the wind passing through it. Though the tree itself is continuous,
we don't struggle with where exactly a trunk becomes a branch. We perceive
distinctions because we have learned to. In this way, we are all artists of
form, unconsciously choosing the boundaries of what we believe is real.

But also perhaps this: these choices are not made alone. Each of us inherits a
vast cultural lineage of forms already chosen. Language, metaphor, categories of
thought—all of these are passed down, often invisibly, like a river carving the
same path through generations. The ancient ones named the stars; the modern ones
name the pixels. We live in a world saturated with the accumulated choices of
others—choices made in hope, in fear, in power, in love. In this way, we are
never merely perceiving, we are participating in a shared vision of separation,
shaped over eons.

Maybe this: what we call “separate” is simply what has been made meaningful.
When something matters—when it feeds us, shelters us, threatens us, or enchants
us—we name it. Trunk, branch, stick, twig, sprig, stump, timber, log, etc.-so
many words for wood because it warmed our bodies and built our homes. Yet only
one word for sky (excluding metaphors of course), because we could not hold it,
could not use it, could only wonder at it. These choices are not fixed lines but
ancient agreements passed down, rooted in the needs of survival, in utility, in
the stories we told ourselves to make sense of the world. What we separate from
totality is what we choose to see ever more closely-to dimensionalize,
recursively. But in doing so, we risk forgetting the whole from which the parts
came.

Or perhaps even this: there is something deeper still, beyond perception and
culture—an apparent choosing that is not human. There are forms we choose, yet
there are also unchosen forms that simply arise. The rhythm of the tides, the
shape of galaxies, the cry of a newborn—these appear to us as the result of some
kind of primal choosing, begun long before any human existed to perceive it. But
no matter what one believes about what came before, the mystery may still be
seen as the first artist of form, shaping the veil of separateness, inviting our
wonder.

So who chooses what is separate from totality? You do. We do. Perhaps the
mystery too? The act of choosing is layered—individual, collective, cosmic. And
perhaps in this dance of choosing and unchoosing, of drawing lines and
dissolving them, we begin to remember not just the forms, but the formlessness
that holds them all.
