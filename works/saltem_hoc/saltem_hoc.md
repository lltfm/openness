# Overview
"Saltem Hoc" is latin for "at least this". It is a teaching method for inviting
the seeker into contemplating what might be true. The method does not impose on
the seeker by telling them directly what is true or insisting on a blind faith
to proceed. Instead, it begins by pointing at something concrete & familiar and
then suggesting speculations or questions that guide the seeker toward deeper
understanding.

> The Soul: At least this: the rhythm of your heartbeat, steady & unseen, carrying
> life without your asking. The thread which connects the laughter of your
> childhood to the wisdom of your aging. But perhaps the soul is also the most
> familiar stranger? Or it might be the ceaseless presence in all that you do not
> see yet but will come to know. Or perhaps it is mirror of your being, showing
> not just who you are, but who you might yet become—a reflection shaped by love
> & loss, by time & eternity entwined. Maybe the soul is the bridge, linking the
> finite and infinite, the part of us that dreams in symbols and eternally
> awakens. Like a flame passed from candle to candle, it is never extinguished,
> only transformed, carrying the warmth of our unique spark back into the vast
> Mystery.
