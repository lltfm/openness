# Overview
"Saltem Hoc" is latin for "at least this". It is a teaching method for inviting
the seeker into contemplating what might be true. The method does not impose on
the seeker by telling them directly what is true or insisting on a blind faith
to proceed. Instead, it begins by pointing at something concrete & familiar and
then suggesting speculations or questions that guide the seeker toward deeper
understanding.

* Example answer:
> What is magic?
>
> At least this: the awe you feel when the first snowflakes of winter quietly
> blanket the world in white. The warmth that spreads through you when a
> stranger offers an unexpected kindness. But perhaps magic is also the moment
> when inspiration strikes, and ideas flow effortlessly as if from another
> realm. Or it might be the silent communication between old friends who can
> share a glance and understand each other's thoughts. Maybe magic is the way
> nature orchestrates itself—the synchrony of fireflies blinking in the night
> or the migration of birds navigating by stars. Or perhaps even, magic is the
> profound mystery that surrounds existence itself, the unseen forces that nudge
> the cosmos and the subtle energies that resonate within us, reminding us that
> there's more to life than meets the eye.
