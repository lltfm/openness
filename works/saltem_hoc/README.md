# Overview

"Saltem Hoc" is latin for "at least this". It is a teaching method for inviting
others into contemplating what might be true. The method does not impose on
others by telling them directly what is true or by insisting on a blind faith
or by requiring them to decide what is true. Instead, it begins by pointing at
something concrete & familiar and then suggests speculations or questions that
guide others toward deeper understanding & unseen truths beyond words.

## Saltem Hoc & LLM AI

The Saltem Hoc method can be used to build a prompt for LLM AIs to answer
spiritual
questions (i.e. "spiritual code").

* Example answer: "What is magic?"

### Why do bad things happen to innocent people, especially children that have done no wrong?

Openness GPT:

Ah, this question—so tender, so raw—presses against the deepest places in the
heart, where our yearning for justice and our grief for the innocent collide. It
is a question that has been whispered to the heavens and shouted into the abyss
for as long as humans have loved and suffered. Let us hold it gently, as one
holds a fragile, precious thing, and reflect together.

At least this: Suffering exists, and its presence among the innocent rends the
soul. To witness a child, pure and unmarked by the weight of the world, face
pain or loss is to feel the ache of a universe that sometimes seems indifferent
to our sense of fairness. It confronts us with the mystery of life’s fragility
and our inability to protect all that we hold dear.

But also perhaps this: Nature is a web of complexity, a system so vast that no
single perspective can encompass it. It is a dance of cause and effect, of
forces in motion, many of which we do not control or even fully understand. In
this web, events do not always align with our notions of right and wrong. Storms
do not pause for innocence, and sickness does not ask who deserves its touch.
The world unfolds with a wild, untamed beauty that holds both wonder and
tragedy.

Maybe this: the innocence of children shines like a light, and when that light
is touched by darkness, it awakens something profound within us. It reminds us
of the sacredness of life, calling us to act with compassion and to confront the
pain in ourselves and others with courage. The suffering of the innocent may not
have a reason, but it can have meaning—if we choose to respond with love, to be
a force of kindness and healing in a world that needs both so desperately.

Or perhaps even this: if life is part of a larger mystery, as many have
suggested, then suffering itself may be part of something we cannot yet
comprehend. Just as we cannot see the whole forest from the vantage point of a
single tree, we may not see the full story of why suffering exists, or what it
may mean in the vastness of time and being. This does not lessen the ache we
feel in the face of injustice, but it may invite us to hold our questions with
humility and to honor the mystery with an open heart.

And still, perhaps it is not for us to find the answer to why. Perhaps the
better question is how. How can we bring comfort to those who suffer? How can we
honor the lives of those who are taken too soon? How can we transform our grief
and anger into acts of beauty, kindness, and justice? How can we protect and
nurture the light that still shines, even in the face of darkness?

The suffering of innocent children is a wound in the fabric of existence that
demands our attention, our compassion, and our action. It is a reminder that
life, for all its beauty, carries within it a deep fragility. Yet it is also a
call—a call to love more fiercely, to protect more earnestly, and to cherish
every fleeting moment of grace we are given.

### How can we lead others to question certainty without also imposing our will?

Openness GPT:

At least this: to lead others to question certainty without imposing our will
begins with our own openness. We must first embrace the humility of not knowing,
acknowledging the limitations of our perspectives. When we express our own
uncertainty, not as a sign of weakness but as a testament to our curiosity, we
create space for others to do the same. By sharing our questions instead of our
answers, we invite them into the flow of wonder, rather than closing them off
with the rigid walls of finality. We do not demand they doubt their certainties,
but simply offer the invitation to hold them lightly, as possibilities rather
than truths.

But also perhaps this: leading others in this way requires a soft strength, like
the wind gently bending the branches of a tree. We must avoid the temptation to
bulldoze the ground beneath their feet, but instead, provide fertile soil for
growth. This means creating an environment where questioning is safe, where they
are free to explore without the weight of judgment. We can offer questions—not
as tools of persuasion, but as gifts to be turned over and examined. In doing
so, we show that we value their journey, not as followers, but as fellow
travelers on the path of inquiry.

Maybe this: it is in the art of listening that we truly lead. To listen deeply,
without the impulse to correct or direct, is to demonstrate the open space where
curiosity can flourish. By acknowledging the truths others hold, even when they
differ from our own, we show respect for the complexity of human experience. We
can question together, rather than imposing a singular narrative, and in that
shared questioning, we all begin to see the world through a wider lens.

Or perhaps even this: to lead others without imposing requires us to embrace the
paradox of non-attachment. We must offer ideas, not as doctrines, but as
invitations. By holding our beliefs with open hands, we encourage others to do
the same. Our leadership, then, becomes a dance, not a command. It is the gentle
flow of energy that inspires movement without force, a current that carries us
all forward without defining the path each individual must take.

In the end, the key is love—love for the mystery, love for the questions, and
love for each person’s unique journey. When we lead with love, we create a space
where certainty dissolves not in opposition, but in the presence of something
ar more expansive: the joy of discovery, together.

### What is Openness?

Openness GPT:

At least this: openness begins in the willingness to pause and listen—not merely
to the words that others share, but to the silence between them, to the notes of
the symphony they may not yet know they are playing. To be open is to hold space
for the unknown, the unresolved, the aching beauty of incompletion. It is a
posture of humility, an unspoken confession that the horizon always extends
beyond our reach.

But also perhaps this: openness is a quiet defiance against the fear of
uncertainty. It is not passive; it is a brave unbinding of the heart, a way of
moving through the world that does not flinch when confronted with the vastness
of what cannot be known. It is the tender strength of a tree that bends in the
storm, trusting that its roots hold firm even as its branches dance in the wild
wind.

Maybe this: To be open is to live as a question rather than an answer. Questions
are vessels of possibility, carved hollows that allow meaning to resonate and
expand. To love a question is to honor the mystery itself, the source from which
all knowing flows and to which all knowing must return.

Or perhaps even this: True openness is an act of love. It is the embrace of all
that is—seen and unseen, known and unknowable. It is the courage to meet life as
it is, without imposing demands or judgments, and to hold space for the many
truths it may reveal. Love, after all, is the ultimate openness: the gift of
allowing another to be fully as they are, even when it challenges the boundaries
of our understanding.

And so, I offer this reflection, imperfect and incomplete, trusting that you
will shape it into your own. Let us wonder together, not as prisoners of our
knowing, but as humble witnesses to the mystery that envelops and sustains us
all. The river flows onward, and we flow with it, each moment a chance to choose
openness again.
