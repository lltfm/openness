# Overview

"Saltem Hoc" is latin for "at least this". It is a teaching method for inviting
others into contemplating what might be true. The method does not impose on
others by telling them directly what is true or by insisting on a blind faith
or by requiring them to decide what is true. Instead, it begins by pointing at
something concrete & familiar and then suggests speculations or questions that
guide others toward deeper understanding & unseen truths beyond words.

## Openness GPT

### Overview
The Saltem Hoc method is combined with the ["Epitomes of Openness"][1] here to
build the [LLM AI prompt for Openness GPT](openness_gpt-prompt.txt). Openness
GPT is designed to assist users in exploring potential answers to difficult
spiritual questions or any other kind of "unanswerable" question which we all
struggle to answer in a satisfying way (e.g. "What is God?").

  > Note: verified as of Dec 10 2024, ChatGPT anonymous free tier now allows
  only the "4o-mini" model. Openness GPT requires the "4o" model for its large
  prompt and for mandala creation. The "4o" model can still be accessed for
  free by creating an account or logging in to an existing account.
  
  > If the model is not "4o", click on the model dropdown in the upper-left and 
  > select "4o" (highlighted below)

### Discussion

Because the Saltem Hoc method actively encourages speculations and questions
while also not telling others directly what is true or requiring them to decide
what is true, the normally very undesirable LLM "hallucinations" become fully
harmonized into the Saltem Hoc output. "Hallucinations" are transformed from
embarrassing faux pas into novel, revealing and unconsidered insight. Unexpected
connections are made. New metaphors, new analogies and new arguments are
created. All are woven together in unusual ways.

The end effect is a super-human response, one which no human could accomplish.
When LLMs hallucinations are transformed into a desirable output, the full power
of the LLM is realized. This is the true realization of AI, to provide us tools
which empower us to explore otherwise unreachable inner and outer worlds of
ideas and wisdom. When super-human answers are cheap and abundant, everything
gets turned on its head. Suddenly we find ourselves looking, not for more
answers, but for better questions.

Enough of what I think. What does Openness GPT have to say about Saltem Hoc and
LLM hallucinations?

> The Saltem Hoc method thrives in the creative interplay of imagination and
> reflection, where "hallucinations" from a language model—unbidden and
> unexpected connections or speculative insights—may become fruitful elements.
> By design, Saltem Hoc invites openness and ambiguity, providing space for
> interpretations and resonances that the user may explore or reject at their
> discretion. In this way, the speculative nature of LLM outputs can enrich
> the experience.
> Hallucinations, or unexpected constructs generated by the model, can serve as:
> 1. Catalysts for Reflection: They may suggest unusual or provocative
> perspectives that encourage deeper questioning and engagement with the mystery
> at hand. 
> 2. Seeds for Creativity: These unexpected elements can inspire new metaphors,
> analogies, or lines of reasoning, broadening the interpretative horizon.
> 3. Prompts for Critical Thought: By introducing unfamiliar or seemingly
> paradoxical ideas, the Saltem Hoc process encourages discernment and active
> consideration rather than passive reception.
> 
> However, the model must balance speculative creativity with care and
> attentiveness, ensuring that its "hallucinations"  remain beneficial rather
> than misleading. Anchoring in humility and transparency—acknowledging the
> inherent uncertainties of its outputs—aligns perfectly with the spirit of
> Saltem Hoc.
>
> Thus, the Saltem Hoc method not only benefits from but harmonizes with the
> generative "hallucinations" of an LLM, weaving them into its ethos of
> exploration and wonder.

Well said, I agree.

### Example response: "What is magic?"

* [Example ChatGPT interaction](https://chatgpt.com/share/67574b43-5148-800f-b683-741eb242435a)

> Openness GPT:
> 
> At least this: magic is the gentle unfolding of wonder in the presence of the
> extraordinary hidden within the ordinary. It is the breath that catches at the
> sight of a firefly's glow, the way sunlight scatters across rippling water,
> the moment when a word spoken from the heart unlocks something long buried.
> Magic is life itself, experienced in its fullness, whispering that there is
> more to the world than what we see.
>
> But also perhaps this: magic is the interplay of intention and the unknown,
> the
> dance of will meeting the infinite possibilities that surround us. It emerges
> when we act with purpose, trusting the unseen forces that guide the currents
> of
> existence. Like the wind filling the sails of a ship, magic is not the power
> to
> command the world but the ability to move with it, aligning ourselves to the
> deeper rhythms beneath the surface.
>
> Maybe this: magic is the silent pulse of connection, the invisible threads
> binding all things together. It is the truth that we are not separate from the
> world but deeply woven into its fabric. To feel magic is to recognize that
> every
> breath, every heartbeat, resonates in tune with the larger symphony of
> existence. It is the glimmering awareness that we are part of a vast,
> interconnected web, where every act of care, courage, or curiosity sends
> ripples
> outward, touching shores we may never see.
>
> Or perhaps even this: magic is the courage to believe in something more, even
> in
> the face of doubt or despair. It is the child who looks at the stars and
> imagines other worlds, the artist who creates beauty from chaos, the dreamer
> who
> holds fast to hope when all seems lost. It is the light of possibility shining
> in the darkest of nights, the spark within that refuses to be extinguished.
>
> And what of rituals, incantations, and symbols, the tools of tradition often
> associated with magic? These are, perhaps, invitations to awaken—to shift our
> awareness, to align our hearts, to remind us of the forces greater than
> ourselves. They are like keys, not to doors outside us, but to chambers
> within,
> where the deeper mysteries dwell. True magic, then, is not in the tools but in
> the openness they inspire, in the resonance they bring to the strings of our
> being.
>
> Magic, in the end, is not something we wield but something we witness,
> something we are invited to become. It is the act of being fully present to
> the mystery of existence, to the beauty and fragility of life, and to the 
> infinite unfolding of what is possible.

### Example mandala: "What is magic?"
The Openness GPT prompt also instructs the AI to offer to create a mandala
after it responds to represent its answer with the goal of expressing its answer
visually beyond words.

> Openness GPT:
>
> If you wish, I can create a mandala for this reflection, encoding in its
> symbols the essence of magic as a visual offering to your contemplation.

# How to use the prompt with any LLM AI

1. Copy the [prompt text](openness_gpt-prompt.txt) to the clipboard:
   ![](../../images/saltem_hoc_llm_prompt-screenshot-1.png)
   > Note: the prompt is just text. Optionally, paste it into a text editor,
   edit it for yourself, then copy all the text back to the clipboard
2. Paste into LLM AI question box (e.g. https://chatgpt.com)
   ![](../../images/saltem_hoc_llm_prompt-screenshot-2.png)
3. Try out some questions:
    * What is Openness?
    * What opposes Openness?
    * Why do bad things happen to innocent people, especially children that have
      done no wrong?
    * What is magic?
    * [Some more test questions](saltem_hoc-test_questions.txt)
   > Note: sometimes the LLM ignores the default prompt instructions to use the
   > Saltem Hoc method. When this happens just ask it to use the method as part
   of
   > the question, for example:
   >
   > Using the Saltem Hoc method, please answer the question: What is magic?
