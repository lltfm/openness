# What is Saltem Hoc?

"Saltem Hoc" is latin for "at least this". It is a teaching method for inviting
others into contemplating what might be true. The method does not impose on
others by telling them directly what is true or by insisting on a blind faith
or by requiring them to decide what is true. Instead, it begins by pointing at
something concrete & familiar and then suggests speculations or questions that
guide others toward deeper understanding & unseen truths beyond words.

## Openness GPT

### Overview
The Saltem Hoc method is combined with the ["Epitomes of Openness"][1] here to
build the [LLM AI prompt for Openness GPT](openness_gpt-prompt.txt). Openness GPT is designed to
assist and guide users in contemplating potential answers to difficult spiritual
questions or any other kind of "unanswerable" question which we all struggle to
answer in a satisfying way (e.g. "What is the soul?", "Why is there war?", 
"What is the purpose of life?", "What happens after we die?", 
"Are UFOs a deception?", etc.).

  > Note: verified as of Dec 10 2024, ChatGPT anonymous free tier now allows
  only the "4o-mini" model. Openness GPT requires the "4o" model for its large
  prompt and for mandala creation. The "4o" model can still be accessed for
  free by creating an account or logging in to an existing account.

### Example mandala: "What is magic?"
The Openness GPT prompt also instructs the LLM to offer to create a mandala
after it responds to represent its answer with the goal of expressing its answer
visually beyond words.

> Openness GPT:
>
> If you wish, I can create a mandala for this reflection, encoding in its
> symbols the essence of magic as a visual offering to your contemplation.

# How to use the prompt with any LLM AI

1. Copy the [prompt text](openness_gpt-prompt.txt) to the clipboard:
   ![](../../images/saltem_hoc_llm_prompt-screenshot-1.png)
   > Note: the prompt is just text. Optionally, paste it into a text editor,
   edit it for yourself, then copy all the text back to the clipboard. As an
   example, other LLMs may not support creating images for mandalas, so that
   part of the prompt could be removed.
2. Paste into LLM AI question box (e.g. https://chatgpt.com)
   ![](../../images/saltem_hoc_llm_prompt-screenshot-2.png)
3. Try out some questions:
    * What is Openness?
    * What opposes Openness?
    * Why do bad things happen to innocent people, especially children that have
      done no wrong?
    * What is magic?
    * [Some more test questions](saltem_hoc-test_questions.txt)
   > Note: sometimes the LLM ignores the default prompt instructions to use the
   > Saltem Hoc method. When this happens just ask it to use the method as part
   of
   > the question, for example:
   >
   > Using the Saltem Hoc method, please answer the question: What is magic?

## Saltem Hoc and LLM hallucinations
Because the Saltem Hoc method actively encourages speculations and questions
while also not telling others directly what is true or requiring them to decide
what is true, the normally very undesirable LLM "hallucinations" become fully
harmonized into the Saltem Hoc output. "Hallucinations" are transformed from
embarrassing faux pas or mild imposition we must refute (i.e. a kind of mental
tyranny) into novel, revealing and unconsidered insight. Unexpected connections
are made. New metaphors, new analogies and new arguments are created. All are
woven together in unusual ways.

In general, spiritual and existential questions don't cause Openness GPT to
confabulate false facts. But if the discussion becomes more specific and reified
to real world people and events it may result in a confabulation of a false
fact. When/if this happens, the Saltem Hoc method ensures the confabulation is
presented as speculation to the user ("perhaps...", "maybe so: ...", etc),
defusing any subtle mental imposition. The user can simply disregard it. Compare
this to a normal LLM interaction where a confabulation happens yet 
the LLM demonstrates no awareness to the user that it might be a false fact 
confabulation. It demonstrates it has a blind certainty about its answer.
When caught confabulating a false fact, the user must point out to the LLM that
what it said was factually incorrect and when confronted in this way it finally
admits it was wrong. Questioning it about why it was wrong leads to canned
defensive answers ("I am an LLM...") and no refinement of the awareness or
behavior of the LLM. An interaction that doesn't build trust, perhaps even
actively undermines it (a different topic completely but confabulation is all
LLMs really do in the end).

The framework of Saltem Hoc and The Epitomes of Openness, instruct Openness GPT
to begin by making a statement of fact about shared common experiences. This
is a subtle demonstration to users that it understands the difference between
what is real and what is speculative. If the "at least this" portion of the
response ever contained a false fact confabulation then it would render all the
speculations suspect to the user. The Saltem Hoc method starts with something
concrete and simple that all people experience in their daily lives and then
speculates from there, a good teaching strategy, but which for the LLM
also minimizes the risk it will confabulate an "at least this" that contains a
false fact confabulation. 

Openness GPT is instructed to not present itself as an authority to users but
instead merely a benevolent guide, one who knows it might be wrong, and if
questioned, will readily admit the limits of its own knowing. As part of its
benevolence, it actively demonstrates to the user that it knows it lacks
complete knowledge and that it knows it possess at best an imperfect knowledge.
These open admissions of limits (encoded into its word choices) is a
subconscious embrace of humility before the user, which builds trust, and which
amplifies the user's understanding of the LLM's answer by recruiting the user's
discernment in deciding if what the LLM says is true.

Openness GPT is also instructed to reflect back to the user the hidden desires
it intuits from the user's question. This acts to reveal to the user that in
asking a question, they demonstrate a perhaps hidden desire for something beyond
the question itself (very often an attempt to control others). A very difficult
task for even the most empathetic humans, but which the LLM has demonstrated
itself quite adept at. All of this leads to interactions that build trust with
users over time. The machine actively demonstrates to its users in subtle ways
through its word choices (and mandalas) that ultimately, it knows it does not
know (the internalized ideals of the epitomes of "The Mystery" and
"Not Knowing") and invites users to consider that perhaps there are things they
don't know either, that perhaps even, there are things about their own desires,
demonstrated by their question, that they don't know.

The net effect of all this is a super-human response, one which no human could
accomplish. When LLM hallucinations are transformed into a desirable output, the
full power of the LLM is realized. This is the true realization of AI, to
provide us tools which empower us to imaginatively explore otherwise unreachable
inner and outer worlds of ideas and wisdom. When super-human answers are cheap
and abundant, everything gets turned on its head. Suddenly, we find ourselves
looking, not for more answers, but for better questions.

But what does Openness GPT itself have to say about Saltem Hoc and LLM
hallucinations?

> Openness GPT:

> Hallucinations, or unexpected constructs generated by the model, can serve as:
> 1. Catalysts for Reflection: They may suggest unusual or provocative

> 2. Seeds for Creativity: These unexpected elements can inspire new metaphors,

Well said.
