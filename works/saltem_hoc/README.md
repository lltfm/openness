# Overview
"Saltem Hoc" is latin for "at least this". It is a teaching method for inviting
the seeker of openness into contemplating what might be true. The method does
not impose on the seeker by telling them directly what is true or insisting on a
blind faith to proceed or requiring them to decide what is true. Instead, it 
begins by pointing at something concrete & familiar and then suggesting 
speculations or questions that guide the seeker toward deeper understanding.

> Inviting us to sit in the discomfort of uncertainty, to contemplate that which

> Gifts given freely, never demanding a blind faith.

## Saltem Hoc & LLM AI
The Saltem Hoc method can be used to build a prompt for LLM AIs to answer spiritual
questions (i.e. "spiritual code").
* Example answer:
> What is magic?
>
> At least this: the awe you feel when the first snowflakes of winter quietly
> blanket the world in white. The warmth that spreads through you when a
> stranger offers an unexpected kindness.
> 
> But perhaps magic is also the moment when inspiration strikes, and ideas flow
> effortlessly as if from another realm.
> 
> Or it might be the silent communication between old friends who can share a
> glance and understand each other's thoughts.
> 
> Maybe magic is the way nature orchestrates itself—the synchrony of fireflies
> blinking in the night or the migration of birds navigating by stars. 
> 
> Or perhaps even, magic is the profound mystery that surrounds existence
> itself, the unseen forces that nudge the cosmos and the subtle energies that
> resonate within us, reminding us that there's more to life than meets the eye.
