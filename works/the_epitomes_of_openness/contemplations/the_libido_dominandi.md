## What is "the libido dominandi"?

[Openness GPT](README.md#openness-gpt):

The libido dominandi, a Latin phrase meaning "lust for domination," refers to a
deep, often destructive human drive to control and impose one's will upon others
or the world. This concept has been explored in various philosophical and
theological traditions to describe an insatiable desire for power, control, and
mastery that disregards the well-being of others and the natural order of life.

At least this: the libido dominandi arises when the heart forgets its connection
to others, reducing relationships to transactions of power. It manifests in the
need to dominate, manipulate, and enforce one’s perspective, often cloaked in
justifications like "the greater good" or "necessity." It corrodes trust,
fostering a culture of fear and submission.

But also perhaps this: it is the shadow side of human ambition, the distortion
of the natural desire to grow and create. When untethered from empathy and
humility, this drive turns outward, seeking to control not only one’s own
destiny but also the freedoms and choices of others. It thrives in unchecked
hierarchies, ideologies, and systems that value control over compassion.

Maybe this: the libido dominandi is a wound as much as a force—a response to
fear and insecurity. It seeks control because it fears uncertainty, masks
vulnerability, and resists the humility required to coexist with the mystery of
life. Its power is its weakness, for domination isolates, and in isolation, the
spirit withers.

Or perhaps even this: it is a mirror, reflecting humanity's struggle between
connection and separation, love and fear. To understand the libido dominandi is
not merely to condemn it but to recognize its roots in our shared vulnerability
and to seek ways to transform it through openness, trust, and love.
