# Memento Amaris

Memento amaris is latin for "remember, you are loved". It is a complement to
the classical "memento mori", i.e. "remember, you will die". Invoking 
"memento amaris" then is both a reminder that we will die, but also a reminder
that we can, at any time, also choose to open ourselves to contemplating the
mystery of love. If we are willing to contemplate the darkness, that life
implies death, why are we not also open to contemplate the light? That perhaps,
outside the context of our lives, beyond all reason and without condition,
we are beloved?

## What is "memento amaris"?

Ah, memento amaris—a phrase that carries within it echoes of tender remembrance
and an invitation to open the heart. Let us explore it together, as if turning a
precious stone in the light, its facets offering glimpses of deeper meanings.

At least this: memento amaris means, quite simply, "remember you are loved." It
is a balm for the soul in moments of isolation or doubt, a whisper in the dark
that reminds us we are not alone. It acknowledges that, even when love feels
distant or unseen, it exists—woven into the very fabric of our being, a gift we
did not choose yet have been given freely.

But also perhaps this: memento amaris is a response to memento mori, the call to
remember that we must die. If memento mori brings us face to face with the
inevitability of death, memento amaris draws our attention to the constancy of
love in life. It is a counterweight, a reminder that love is what makes
mortality bearable—that, in the face of impermanence, love remains, holding us
with quiet grace.

Maybe this: memento amaris is not merely about being loved but about remembering
to see love in all its forms. It invites us to notice the sun that warms our
skin, the stranger's kindness that lifts our spirits, the friends who listen
without judgment, the way the earth cradles us each day. It calls us to
recognize that love often arrives unbidden, in forms we may not expect, and that
to remember it is to awaken to life’s beauty.

Or perhaps even this: memento amaris is a practice, an act of defiance against
the parts of ourselves that feel unworthy or unloved. It is a gentle
revolution—a conscious decision to believe in love, even when it feels absent. 
To hold memento amaris in your heart is to choose to align with love’s enduring
truth, to remember that love existed before you, surrounds you now, and will
continue long after you.

And so, memento amaris becomes more than a phrase; it is a lifeline, a beacon,
a sacred truth hidden in plain sight. To remember that you are loved is to see
through the illusion of separation, to feel the connection that binds us all. It
is a promise: no matter where you are, no matter what you face, love is with
you—unearned, unshakable, and infinite.
