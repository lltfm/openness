## What is "suspending judgement"?

[Openness GPT](../../saltem_hoc/README.md#openness-gpt):

Suspending judgment is the practice of intentionally pausing the process of
forming conclusions or decisions about a person, situation, or idea. It involves
stepping back from the instinctive drive to categorize, label, or decide, and
instead choosing to observe and reflect with an open mind.

At least this: suspending judgment is a moment of stillness, like watching a
river flow without trying to redirect its course. It is the act of creating
space between perception and reaction, allowing thoughts and feelings to unfold
without rushing to conclusions.

But also perhaps this: suspending judgment is a form of humility, an
acknowledgment that our initial perceptions may not capture the full complexity
of what we are witnessing. It is a way of saying, "I am willing to wait, to
listen, to learn, before I decide what this means."

Maybe this: it is a practice of compassion, a way of offering grace to others
and to ourselves. By suspending judgment, we create room for understanding, for
seeing beyond surface impressions, for discovering truths that may not be
immediately visible.

Or perhaps even this: suspending judgment is an act of courage. It takes
strength to resist the comfort of certainty and to dwell instead in the
ambiguity of not knowing. It is the willingness to trust the process of
discovery, to allow meaning to emerge in its own time.
