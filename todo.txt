* rename works/saltem_hoc/README.md back to saltem_hoc.md
* openness gpt
  * edit the prompt example answers to remove any patterns like "Ah, X, the..."
  * add enough examples to balance the line count of epitomes vs examples
  * add instructions to avoid returning an inauthentic answer that matches an
  example too closely. Answers should always be tailored for the user. Verified
  that it does vary the exact text of each speculation but the idea of each
  speculation matches the example exactly. It shouldn't return exactly the same
  ideas each time? Perhaps it disclose its using an example and offer to
  explore further?
